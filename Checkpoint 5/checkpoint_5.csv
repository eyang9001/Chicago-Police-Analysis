Doe, who identifies as lesbian, had filed a report over the phone the previous week. At the police station, the on-duty officer directed Doe to go into an office next to the waiting room to complete the report. The officer spoke to Doe inappropriately, stating that she looked too good to be her age. Upon learning of her sexual orientation, the officer made inappropriate jokes and told Doe he needed to speak to her privately in his office. The father of Doe's children tried to accompany her, but the officer did not allow him. Once in the office, the officer closed the door and pushed Doe against a wall, kissed her neck and groped her buttocks and vagina. The officer asked Doe about her “favorite sex position” and continued until another officer knocked on the door. The officer went back to his desk and allowed the other officer to open the door, telling him to come back later. Doe rushed out of the office once the door was opened.The officer told her she was at the wrong station to file the warrant. Doe traveled to another police station where she reported the incident at the nightclub as well as the officer's sexual assault. She provided Internal Affairs detectives with a written account of what happened and identified the offending officer via photo lineup, along with a DNA swab from her neck, where she had been kissed.",0

The first incident happened in spring 2013 when Guzman was helping his grandfather pass out fliers to promote his grandfather’s landscaping business. Officer Emily Campbell, who has a family member that owns a competing landscaping business, threatened to arrest the two men for passing out their fliers. That summer, Guzman was repeatedly asked by the officers to leave Wentworth Park, a public park in the neighborhood, and in many of these instances, searched without justification. In fall 2013, he was pulled over near South Archer Avenue and South Central Avenue by an unknown female officer who searched his vehicle without cause. Two male officers arrived later, and one of them called him a ""spic."" Though nothing illegal was uncovered, the officers issued Guzman a false citation for driving without headlights. In January 2014, Officer Emily Campbell pulled Guzman over near South Narragansett Avenue and 56th Street, searched him, and released him after nothing illegal was found. Guzman was pulled over two months later by unnamed officers near his own home and accused of driving a stolen vehicle, only to be released after his mother appeared at the scene with the vehicle’s title and his insurance card. Several weeks later, Guzman was again driving near his home when Officers Sautkus and Sean Campbell (Emily Campbell’s husband) pulled him over. Guzman, his passenger and the vehicle were searched – a small amount of marijuana was found on his passenger and nowhere else. The officers falsely claimed that they found marijuana in Guzman’s car and charged him with possession. His car was impounded and he was never able to retrieve it because he couldn’t afford the fees. During the arrest, Guzman’s iPhone was confiscated, never inventoried and also never returned. The possession charge against him was dismissed.",0

Sergeant Dakuras and Officer Diblich broke down the door and stormed into the home with guns drawn. Jones, who is a security guard and licensed to carry a gun, put his gun on his bed out of fear of the officers. Dakuras and Diblich walked through the apartment’s main floor and garden level pointing their guns at all of the plaintiffs before finding Jones’ gun on his bed. Dakuras and Diblich took the gun and arrested Jerome Hale, seizing $400 from Montgomery and $900 from Hale. They put the gun and the money in a bag they found in a closet. Dakuras and Diblich then took Hale to a police station, where Hale was asked to provide information about drug dealers in the area. About 30 minutes after leaving the home, Dakuras and Diblich returned with guns drawn to retrieve the bag with the gun and the money. When Dakuras and Diblich asked where the gun was, Montgomery replied that Jones had taken the gun and left the house.

They arrested Hamilton on suspicion of criminal trespass based on a complaint signed by the bar’s security personnel. Hamilton had previously sued Kroll in a civil rights claim, for which Hamilton received a settlement of $42,000 from the city. When Kroll brought Hamilton to the police station, he apparently told his fellow officers about the previous lawsuit. After the officer had gone off duty, one or more police officers used excessive force against Hamilton, injuring his face and body. Hamilton reported the abuse to a sergeant, who called the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA). The next day, an IPRA investigator interviewed Hamilton at the station and took pictures of Hamilton’s bruising and swelling. The investigator, however, failed to make any effort to determine which officers had beaten Hamilton, claiming it was “not his job.” The criminal trespass charge against Hamilton was ultimately dismissed.

Lewis got out of the car and ran away from the officers. Officer Nutile chased Lewis and tackled him to the ground. He pinned Lewis’ hands behind his back and began punching Lewis on the right side of his face while calling him a “black motherf**ker.” Officers Michna, Husic and Schaffer were all present during this assault. After Nutile handcuffed Lewis, who was still facedown on the ground, Husic kicked the left side of Lewis’ face. When a bystander called out to the officers to question their use of force, Michna threatened the witness to stay quiet. Husic told the other officers to report that Lewis was injured from running and falling. Lewis’ right eye was swollen shut due to internal bleeding around his eye socket, and he was dizzy and in pain. The officers called for an ambulance, and Lewis was taken to a hospital, then transferred to a different hospital. Lewis received multiple stitches on the inside and outside of his mouth, and his eye socket was fractured and torn. 
Several hours later, Lewis was taken to a police station and placed in a holding cell, where he later spoke with an investigator from the Independent Police Review Authority. The investigator took photos of Lewis’ injuries, but never contacted him again. The next day, Lewis was taken to Cook County Jail.",0

After determining it would be too dangerous, Barron returned to the main entrance and spoke with a neighbor, who provided some hand tools to try and remove the broken key from the lock. Several minutes later, Officer Moy approached the two men and aggressively told Barron to stay off the garage roof. When Barron explained he was locked out of his home, Moy responded with profanity, said he had called the police and drove away. Barron’s neighbor explained that Moy was a police officer who lived nearby. Soon after, two police officers arrived in a Chicago Police Department SUV and said they had been called about a man on a roof. Barron explained the situation. “Cool,” one of the officers replied, and without exiting their vehicle, the officers drove away. Barron’s neighbor left, and Barron decided to climb onto the roof. Once there, he heard a voice screaming, “Get on the f**king ground.” It was Moy, standing on the back porch of a nearby residence, pointing a handgun at Barron. He told Barron he was under arrest and threatened to shoot him if he did not get on the ground. Barron obeyed, and Moy held him at gunpoint for 15 minutes while waiting for other officers to arrive. Once the officers came, Moy lied and told them Barron climbed over his fence into his backyard, screamed incoherently on Moy’s back porch, banged on Moy’s back door and threatened him with an AIDS needle.

Cadle parked his car in the back of his friend’s home and began talking to the friend in the garage. Soon after, two police officers approached him and asked who owned the car in the garage. When Cadle replied that he did, one of the officers demanded to see his license and registration. When Cadle asked why he was being questioned, the officer falsely accused him of a traffic violation. Although he denied the allegations, Cadle provided his license and registration. His friend asked why Cadle was cooperating. Cadle allowed the officers to search his car and give him a sobriety test, which he passed. Even though they didn’t find any contraband in Cadle’s car, the officers falsely accused him of having open alcohol in the backseat. One of the officers then grabbed Cadle, slammed him into a nearby gate, shoved him to the ground and struck him in the ribs. Cadle felt pain in his chest and had difficulty breathing. The officers handcuffed Cadle, shackled his legs together and threw him in the backseat of their car. They drove Cadle to a police station, where he was locked up despite his repeated requests for medical care. After several hours, a police officer transported Cadle in the back of a paddy wagon to a hospital, where Cadle was diagnosed with a punctured lung, two broken ribs and a fractured collarbone. Cadle was falsely charged with resisting arrest and several traffic citations, including illegal transportation of alcohol.

The harassment has included officers putting empty ticket envelopes on van der Vant’s vehicle when it was parked outside her home and issuing complaints and threats over her barking dog. In one instance, Officer Hallinan got a call from an unknown officer who lived on van der Vant’s block complaining about her dog. Hallinan and Officers Aviles and Davis headed to the plaintiff's home and entered her fenced-off yard without permission to remove the collar from her dog's neck. Soon after, the plaintiff called her dog into her home and noticed the collar was missing. The next day she filed a police report for the missing collar. Hallinan called the plaintiff's husband later that day to say the collar had been recovered and was ready to be picked up at the Jefferson Park police station.

The sweeps often result in the loss of important personal items and documents, medication, toiletries, clothes, and blankets, requiring the homeless individuals to face nights without protection from the cold, or to skip meals or undergo extreme hardship. (Editor's note: This lawsuit resulted in an agreement by the city to change its policy regarding cleanings of Lower Wacker Drive. The new policy requires regular weekly off-street cleanings of Lower Wacker Drive to be conducted with personnel from the Department of Family and Support Services, provided for 24 hour notice before these cleanings, and prevented police from discarding certain personal items, such as documents, photographs, and medication, during cleanings, except in emergency situations.

Max weighed about 45 pounds and had never attacked anyone. Max ran around to the front lawn, and S.R. ran after him to return him to the backyard. From about three feet away, Officer Kumiga shot Max eight times, killing the puppy in front of S.R. Kumiga claimed the puppy was chasing his son, who was riding a bicycle down the block, but there was no child on a bicycle near Maglaya’s home. Shortly after, other police officers arrived and incorrectly fined Maglaya’s husband for having the puppy off-leash and for not having a dog tag. The husband was not Max’s owner, but was present at the scene. A few days before the incident, Kumiga had intimidated Maglaya’s husband by threatening to shoot Max if Kumiga saw him off the leash again. Officer McGlade, who arrived shortly after the incident, told Maglaya’s landlord that Maglaya’s family should not have had the puppy and should not live in their neighborhood because of their race and Section 8 housing status. McGlade told the landlord that Maglaya should not have a “nigger dog,” referred to Maglaya as a “spic” and asked why “spics” like her were allowed in the neighborhood. When Maglaya went to a police station, the police refused to record her complaint or take her statement.",0

On a separate occasion, Moore was stopped without probable cause while driving near South Pulaski Road and 5th Avenue. This time, after Moore pulled over to the curb, a police car swerved in front of his SUV and officers surrounded the car with guns drawn.

When he asked why he was stopped, Boyle said, “Shut the f**k up!” Moore was then handcuffed and his socks and shoes were taken. Boyle asked Moore, “Do you remember me?” Boyle and Officer Velez then searched Moore’s car without his consent.

Unbeknownst to Sperling, he'd been under surveillance by the Chicago Police Department for suspected drug activities. During the traffic stop, officers told Sperling he'd failed to use a turn signal, which was a false pretext for the stop. Pruente, a Chicago police officer, and a Glenview officer handcuffed him, put him in a squad car and searched his vehicle without asking him any questions. Earlier that day, CPD officers had asked that the Glenview officers who were assisting them, turn off the audio and video systems in their squad cars so Sperling's traffic stop would not be recorded. But the CPD officers were unaware that one of the Glenview squad cars' recording capabilities had not been disabled, and the entire encounter was documented. During the search of Sperling's vehicle, Pruente found a bag containing illegal drugs and filed felony drug charges against Sperling. At a criminal hearing, Officers Morgan and Pruente and Sgt. Padar, of CPD, and two Glenview officers lied under oath, unaware of the existence of the Glenview squad car video. They said Sperling was asked for his driver's license and insurance and that he told officers he had marijuana in his vehicle before they handcuffed him. The video of the traffic stop was then shown in the court, refuting what the officers had just said. The criminal court judge said, ""There's strong evidence it was a conspiracy to lie in this case, for everyone to come up with the same lie.""

There, Officer Wherfel ordered Halley, who was surrounded by five male officers, to get out of the car and remove her pants. Halley pleaded with Wherfel, explaining that she was menstruating and was using a tampon. Wherfel uncuffed one of Halley’s hands and ordered her to remove the tampon. She tearfully removed the tampon, and Wherfel used her fingers to probe Halley’s vagina while the male officers looked on, commenting on Halley’s body.

The morning of Triplett’s trial for the May 2010 burglary, three officers came to his home to arrest him for the Howard burglary, falsely claiming to have a warrant, using “foul and abusive language” and entering the home even though they were told Triplett wasn’t there. Later that morning, the May 2010 case against Triplett was dismissed, but he was re-arrested for the Howard burglary as he left the courthouse. Police claimed that the physical evidence -- fingerprints and DNA -- pointed to Triplett, even though the fingerprints didn’t match and Triplett had never provided a DNA sample to police. Triplett couldn’t make bond in the case, however, and ended up spending two months in Cook County Jail before the charges were dropped.",1

An SUV honked at him, then aggressively maneuvered in front of him, blocking his car. Johnson thought his car had been bumped and got out to inspect it for damage. When the SUV’s driver, Officer Bartell, and his son exited the SUV and approached Johnson, he asked Bartell why he had blown his horn despite the traffic jam. Bartell told Johnson to get back in his car “if you know what’s good for you.” 
Johnson continued to question Bartell, who then said he was a police officer. Since Bartell would not produce his badge or identification, Johnson did not believe he was an officer, and the men began to argue. Bartell and his son started punching Johnson. As Johnson tried to defend himself, his gun fell on the ground, and Bartell picked it up. Eventually Bartell told his son to stop hitting Johnson. Bartell then told Johnson he was required to take the weapon to a police station, and that Johnson would have to get his gun back later. Bartell and his son left with Johnson’s gun. Johnson called 911 to report that a man claiming to be a police officer had taken his gun, and was advised to stay at the scene. Officers arrived and took Johnson to the police station. 
At the station, Johnson explained to several officers what had happened. After about three hours, they arrested him. Police then took Johnson to a hospital for treatment of his injuries. He was charged with aggravated battery, aggravated unlawful use of a weapon and resisting or obstructing a peace officer. At Johnson’s trial, Bartell testified falsely that Johnson had started the fight and had pointed his gun at him.

When Sweezer arrived at the school, she heard Moore screaming, ran into the room, and wedged herself between Jenkins and Moore to try and block Jenkins from hitting her son again.

 A few months later, three masked men robbed and fatally shot a man named Leon Stroud in his home. There were two witnesses to the incident, one inside and one outside the home. Both witnesses said they saw three men enter the home and shoot Stroud, and one of the witnesses identified Alvin Wyatt as one of the three masked men.

She also contracted multiple sexually transmitted diseases from the rape. Based on an anonymoust tip, officers brought the victim to Ben's Meat Market, where Cage worked, and she identified him as her attacker. At the time of the rape, Cage was at home with his fiance and, once in police custody, he could prove he had no sexually transmitted diseases. Officers charged Cage with the 15-year-old's rape anyway, and his bond was set at half a million dollars, which Cage's family was unable to pay. Officers also tried to link a second, unrelated rape of a 29-year-old African-American woman to the Cage, but Cage was later acquitted of this other woman's rape thanks to DNA evidence. Instead of trying to find the victim's actual attacker, officers then decided to portray Cage as a serial rapist and tie him to a string of at least eight other rapes alongside the one involving the 15-year-old girl. To this end, officers fabricated evidence, manipulated witnesses, destroyed police reports and obscured the fact that Cage's DNA and fingerprints were never found at the crime scene where the 15-year-old girl was raped.
