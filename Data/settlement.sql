Doe, who identifies as lesbian, had filed a report over the phone the previous week. At the police station, the on-duty officer directed Doe to go into an office next to the waiting room to complete the report. The officer spoke to Doe inappropriately, stating that she looked too good to be her age. Upon learning of her sexual orientation, the officer made inappropriate jokes and told Doe he needed to speak to her privately in his office. The father of Doe's children tried to accompany her, but the officer did not allow him. Once in the office, the officer closed the door and pushed Doe against a wall, kissed her neck and groped her buttocks and vagina. The officer asked Doe about her “favorite sex position” and continued until another officer knocked on the door. The officer went back to his desk and allowed the other officer to open the door, telling him to come back later. Doe rushed out of the office once the door was opened.The officer told her she was at the wrong station to file the warrant. Doe traveled to another police station where she reported the incident at the nightclub as well as the officer's sexual assault. She provided Internal Affairs detectives with a written account of what happened and identified the offending officer via photo lineup, along with a DNA swab from her neck, where she had been kissed.
2	14-cv-4800	9	$35,000.00	2016-06-22 00:00:00		0	0	Guzman was the victim of a series of unwarranted stops and searches in addition to threats, racial harassment and false allegations by officers in Garfield Ridge, where he and the officers live. The first incident happened in spring 2013 when Guzman was helping his grandfather pass out fliers to promote his grandfather’s landscaping business. Officer Emily Campbell, who has a family member that owns a competing landscaping business, threatened to arrest the two men for passing out their fliers. That summer, Guzman was repeatedly asked by the officers to leave Wentworth Park, a public park in the neighborhood, and in many of these instances, searched without justification. In fall 2013, he was pulled over near South Archer Avenue and South Central Avenue by an unknown female officer who searched his vehicle without cause. Two male officers arrived later, and one of them called him a "spic." Though nothing illegal was uncovered, the officers issued Guzman a false citation for driving without headlights. In January 2014, Officer Emily Campbell pulled Guzman over near South Narragansett Avenue and 56th Street, searched him, and released him after nothing illegal was found. Guzman was pulled over two months later by unnamed officers near his own home and accused of driving a stolen vehicle, only to be released after his mother appeared at the scene with the vehicle’s title and his insurance card. Several weeks later, Guzman was again driving near his home when Officers Sautkus and Sean Campbell (Emily Campbell’s husband) pulled him over. Guzman, his passenger and the vehicle were searched – a small amount of marijuana was found on his passenger and nowhere else. The officers falsely claimed that they found marijuana in Guzman’s car and charged him with possession. His car was impounded and he was never able to retrieve it because he couldn’t afford the fees. During the arrest, Guzman’s iPhone was confiscated, never inventoried and also never returned. The possession charge against him was dismissed.

Officers at the station ordered Miller to participate in a strip search. Miller was handcuffed, placed in a head lock and kicked by Officer White. The kick broke multiple bones in Miller’s face and lacerated one of his eyes. Miller did not resist or hit the officers during this encounter. Other officers witnessed White’s abuse of Miller but none intervened. Miller was placed in a cell and pleaded to the other officers for medical attention. He was taken to a hospital after a shift change two hours later.

Price exited his vehicle and began filming the encounter on his phone. Rodriguez told Price to put his hands on the hood of his car. Price complied, and continued to record the encounter on his phone. Rodriguez punched Price in the face, pulled him backward and slammed him to the ground. While Price was lying facedown on the ground, Rodriguez kneeled on his back, grabbed his head and slammed Price’s forehead against the pavement. Price began screaming for help as Rodriguez tried to take his phone. A few minutes later, several other officers arrived and began kicking Price as he lay on the ground. Officer Barak pepper sprayed Price, and Officer Kirschner used a Taser on Price twice. The officers handcuffed Price and continued kicking him and stomping on his head. They mocked Price for screaming for help during the incident, and took his phone. Price was charged with obstructing arrest, driving on an invalid driver’s license and other charges. About seven months later, the charge of obstructing arrest was dismissed. As a result of the incident, Price suffered from black eyes, bruises, cuts and swelling.

11	15-cv-9089	8	$40,000.00	2015-05-29 00:00:00		0	0	﻿Montano was driving his car when Officer Wallace pulled him over, handcuffed him and falsely accused him of possessing illegal drugs. After searching Montano's car, Wallace arrested him, even though he did not find any illegal drugs in the vehicle. On the way to the police station, Montano told Wallace he was diabetic and needed to get his insulin out of his car. Montano continued to request his insulin after they arrived at the station and told Wallace he was getting sick. Wallace moved Montano to a different room and handcuffed him to a pole. Two hours later, Montano began screaming for help and told two officers, including Wallace, that he was having a “diabetic attack.” Though the officers ignored Montano and tried to continue processing him, a supervisor entered the room and told the officers to call an ambulance. Montano was then taken to the hospital and diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis. He stayed in the intensive care unit until the following afternoon. Montano was charged with possession of cannabis, but the charge was terminated two months later.

When Officers Rivera, Haidari and Pivaral arrived, they ran his name through their system and falsely told Redmond there was a warrant for his arrest.

Haidari prepared a complaint for a search warrant for Redmond, alleging that Redmond had been involved in the delivery of a controlled substance. Redmond was arrested and spent several weeks in jail.

15	16-cv-3201	11	$70,000.00	2015-04-07 00:00:00		0	0	﻿Tolbert Jones and his grandson Colin Craybeek live in the garden level of a three-floor apartment on Chicago’s North Side. Onzell Hale Washington lives with her son Jerome Hale and grandson Dejong Montgomery on the main floor. All of the plaintiffs heard a loud banging at the building's front door. Sergeant Dakuras and Officer Diblich broke down the door and stormed into the home with guns drawn. Jones, who is a security guard and licensed to carry a gun, put his gun on his bed out of fear of the officers. Dakuras and Diblich walked through the apartment’s main floor and garden level pointing their guns at all of the plaintiffs before finding Jones’ gun on his bed. Dakuras and Diblich took the gun and arrested Jerome Hale, seizing $400 from Montgomery and $900 from Hale. They put the gun and the money in a bag they found in a closet. Dakuras and Diblich then took Hale to a police station, where Hale was asked to provide information about drug dealers in the area. About 30 minutes after leaving the home, Dakuras and Diblich returned with guns drawn to retrieve the bag with the gun and the money. When Dakuras and Diblich asked where the gun was, Montgomery replied that Jones had taken the gun and left the house. Dakuras and Diblich grabbed Montgomery, yanked his arm, took him to their squad car and threatened to arrest him if Jones did not return and give them the gun. One of the plaintiffs called Jones, who returned and gave his gun to Dakuras and Diblich. When Jones asked how he could get his gun back, Dakuras replied, “You’re never getting your f**king gun back.” Hale was eventually released from the police station. The gun and the money were never returned.

Jackson provided a valid driver’s license and proof of insurance. The officers handcuffed Jackson and searched his car but did not find anything illegal. The officers told Jackson they would strip-search him, and put him in the backseat of their police car. Doskocz and Schmid pulled Jackson’s pants down and violently beat and struck him. They did not find anything illegal. The officers told Jackson to leave the area, and Jackson sought medical treatment for cuts across his face, scalp and neck, as well as a burst blood vessel in one eye.
17	15-cv-4890	5	$20,000.00	2015-03-22 00:00:00	3500 S. Halsted St.	-87.646404000000004	41.8305750000000032	﻿Hamilton was at a bar when he realized his phone and several other patrons’ phones had been stolen. The bar’s security called the police, and Officer Kroll and another officer arrived at the scene. They arrested Hamilton on suspicion of criminal trespass based on a complaint signed by the bar’s security personnel. Hamilton had previously sued Kroll in a civil rights claim, for which Hamilton received a settlement of $42,000 from the city. When Kroll brought Hamilton to the police station, he apparently told his fellow officers about the previous lawsuit. After the officer had gone off duty, one or more police officers used excessive force against Hamilton, injuring his face and body. Hamilton reported the abuse to a sergeant, who called the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA). The next day, an IPRA investigator interviewed Hamilton at the station and took pictures of Hamilton’s bruising and swelling. The investigator, however, failed to make any effort to determine which officers had beaten Hamilton, claiming it was “not his job.” The criminal trespass charge against Hamilton was ultimately dismissed. Hamilton was wearing diamond earrings when arrested, which were removed once he was taken into custody. His earrings were never returned to him.

Spearman was handcuffed, and the officers told her they had a warrant for her home. After illegally searching Spearman’s home, the officers confessed they did not have a search warrant, and broke down the door to another apartment. In that apartment they found drugs, paraphernalia and thousands of dollars in cash. Elizondo gave Spearman $1,000 in cash for “her troubles” and left.

Lexington St.	-87.7134219000000002	41.8720098000000007	Baines was outside his house in the East Garfield Park neighborhood when Officers Garcia and Pronek pulled up in a squad car and told him not to move and to raise his hands. Although Baines was not breaking any laws, he complied. At the same time, three individuals in a nearby car ran off. The officers found a gun near the car and arrested Baines. Baines was charged with unlawful use of a weapon and criminal trespass to a vehicle, and spent six months in jail until he was found not guilty.

Wilson Ave.	-87.6694346000000024	41.9652245999999991	Iheme, who is disabled from multiple back surgeries, was driving when he noticed a police SUV tailing him. The SUV turned on its lights and pulled him over. When Officers Palmer and O'Reilly got to the plaintiff's car, he asked what he had done wrong. The officers told the plaintiff they didn't need a reason or to explain why they'd pulled him over. Iheme told the officers of his disability, but they ignored him and aggressively pushed him against his car to handcuff him. The officers put Iheme into the police SUV and searched his car. Scared and in pain, the plaintiff asked to go to a hospital and for officers to explain why he'd been stopped and handcuffed. The officers ignored him. Thirty minutes later, the officers finished searching the plaintiff's car, finding nothing illegal. They then told the plaintiff he was free to go. Iheme again asked to be taken to a hospital, but the officers again ignored him. Later that night Iheme took himself to a hospital to get relief for his back injury, which had been aggravated by the officers' treatment.

The family dog, Tango, began barking from about six feet away from the officers, but did not approach them or growl at them. Laura Thompson assured the officers that Tango would not hurt them, to which Officer Vincent said, “He’s got to go.” Vincent shot Tango three times, and Tango ran into a nearby bedroom, injured and bleeding. The officers asked Derek Thompson about selling drugs, and Derek Thompson explained that he had a full-time job and did not sell drugs. The officers searched Derek Thompson and the home without finding any drugs or other contraband. They accused Derek Thompson of having a gun in his bedroom, but Derek Thompson denied owning a gun. Officers Coda and Guerrero arrested him and Officer Medrano approved the arrest. Derek was taken to Cook County Jail, where he stayed for more than a month before posting bond. As a result of the arrest, Derek lost his job at a company where he had worked full-time for 20 years. Because he lost his job, his home went into foreclosure. More than a year later, Derek was found not guilty of all charges. Tango died soon after the incident.

The officers approached Roberts’ car with guns drawn and ordered him to get out. One or more of the officers pushed him to the ground, and one of them said, “Don’t make me f**king shoot you.” The officers searched Roberts’ pockets and wallets, locating his IPRA ID. Officer Ellison ran back to the police car and turned off its video recording equipment. Roberts was handcuffed and began to plead with the officers to loosen the handcuffs, or use multiple pairs, because they were too tight. The officers ignored Roberts and put him in the back of a squad car, with Officer Adams asking, “What are you going to tell me next, you can’t breathe?” Roberts begged, “I’m 6’3”, 315 pounds, these handcuffs are too tight.” One of the officers replied, “That’s your fault.” The officers removed Roberts from the car and pushed him to the ground. He lost control of his bowels, and was eventually taken to a police station, where he remained locked up in soiled clothes overnight. Despite repeated requests, Roberts was never allowed to speak with a supervisor or report his injuries. At one point during the night, an unknown officer looked in Roberts’ cell, laughed at him and walked away. Roberts was eventually given tickets for multiple minor traffic violations and a charge of driving under the influence. The tickets had a box to indicate whether the incident was recorded on video. The officers did not indicate there were any videos, despite the fact that Roberts’ driving was captured on tape before it was turned off. The officers also checked the “No” box on the Alcohol Influence Report that asked if the incident was video recorded. Following a bench trial, Roberts was acquitted of the DUI charge.

They requested assistance from “someone with a Taser.” One of the officers followed McDonald on foot while the other drove his police vehicle slowly alongside. The officers again requested a Taser and continued to follow McDonald as he turned south on Pulaski Road. Several other police vehicles arrived on the scene and positioned themselves in front of and behind McDonald. Officers Van Dyke and Walsh drove up in their marked Chevy Tahoe, parked in the middle of Pulaski, immediately exited their vehicles and drew their weapons. McDonald immediately changed direction, jogging away from the officers as he crossed Pulaski Road. Officer Van Dyke began shooting, hitting McDonald, the force of the bullet spinning him around. As McDonald fell to the ground on his right side, Officer Van Dyke continued shooting, ultimately hitting McDonald with 16 bullets throughout his body. Although there were at least 10 officers on the scene, only Van Dyke felt the need to use deadly force. After shooting him, Officer Van Dyke walked up to McDonald and kicked the knife out of his hand. McDonald, who was 17 years old, was pronounced dead at Mt. Sinai Hospital at 10:42 p.m. After the shooting, officers took one witness to a police station and questioned her for six hours, repeatedly trying to get her to change her story that McDonald was not a threat to the officers when Van Dyke shot him, telling her that her story “did not match the video,” which they refused to show her. Also after the shooting, several officers entered the Burger King at 4060 S. Pulaski Road and demanded the password to the surveillance video system.

McGee told the officers that her son was only 10 years old and didn’t know about any guns. Police searched J.A. and found nothing. They put him in the back of the squad car. McGee called 911 and asked to speak to a supervisor. Meanwhile, more officers arrived, and J.A. was taken to a police station. Sgt. Reynolds refused to tell McGee why her son was being arrested. At the station, officers swore and yelled at J.A. while questioning him about gang activity, frightening the boy, who had no information about gangs. McGee was not permitted to see her son, and officers laughed at and ridiculed her, threatening to arrest her and charge her with child neglect. J.A. was released, but issued a citation for urinating in public. McGee believes that the incident was the result of racial discrimination, as she and her son are African- American and the officers are white.

Palmer told the officers several times that he needed insulin. He became weak, unable to walk and vomited several times throughout the rest of the day. The following morning, the officers transported Palmer, who was visibly dehydrated, to a hospital for medical treatment. After receiving an IV of fluids, Palmer was given the wrong type of insulin, but was transported back to the police station anyway. He did not receive medical care again until late that night, when he was taken to a different hospital where his insulin could be properly administered. On the brink of a diabetic coma, Palmer remained at the hospital for several days.

Fulson had no connection to the incident and had not committed a crime but was taken into custody and put in a squad car as officers searched his business without a warrant. Officers claimed to have found contraband. As a result, Robinson and Officers Kasput, Vazquez, Venegas and Murzyn charged Fulson with criminal drugs and firearms charges. Fulson, a diabetic, was taken to a police station for processing, but was not given the insulin he repeatedly told officers he needed. Eventually an ambulance was called for Fulson.

A 12-year-old witness had told officers that she saw two men wearing all black with black backpacks. Diaz was wearing blue jeans, white sneakers and a black coat, and had a gold and black backpack. Officers manipulated the 12-year-old, telling her they were showing her a man who may have been one of the attempted burglars before bringing in Diaz. Later, officers falsified paperwork to make it appear that the witness had specified that the attempted burglars were two "Hispanic males." Based on the 12-year-old's identification, Diaz was arrested and spent over a year in jail awaiting trial before he was acquitted of all charges.

Although they didn’t find anything illegal, the officers brought Hobson to a detention center nearly 12 miles away instead of the police station a few blocks from the apartment. The officers questioned Hobson about a murder investigation, and said Hobson could help himself by giving the officers information. When Hobson said he did not have any relevant information, the officers left. Later, Officers McFadden, Horton, Slechter and Gomez entered the room and pointed two Taser guns at Hobson. McFadden told Hobson to “get [his] black ass naked” or McFadden would use a Taser on Hobson “until he pissed and s**t himself.” The other officers taunted Hobson, hurling racial slurs at him and telling him to “hurry up” and “get his black ass naked right now” before he got “f**ked up” or “Tasered.” McFadden told Hobson to bend over and spread his butt cheeks. After Hobson obeyed, the officers repeatedly instructed Hobson to lift his penis and testicles, while one officer placed a Taser near Hobson’s testicles and threatened to use it on his genitals. During one of the strip searches, McFadden put on dirty leather gloves and ordered Hobson to open his mouth. McFadden put several fingers in Hobson’s mouth while three Tasers and a loaded gun were pointed at him. By this point, Hobson was naked and crying. McFadden then ordered Gomez to place his gun inside Hobson’s mouth. Gomez held his gun inside Hobson’s mouth for about three minutes, while the other officers joked that Gomez “should have put a condom on [his] gun before placing it in [Hobson’s] mouth.” Hobson eventually vomited several times in the interrogation room before being transported to Cook County Jail, where he informed a doctor about intense headaches.

Vaughn left the apartment, hoping she would calm down. When he returned later that evening, the argument resumed. She ordered him to leave and called the police. Vaughn left, but realized he had left his heavy winter jacket and walked back to retrieve it. While waiting to be let back into the apartment, Officers Akinbusuyi and Torres arrived at the scene and attempted to restrain and handcuff Vaughn without talking to him or his former girlfriend to assess the situation. Vaughn tried to avoid getting handcuffed, so the officers responded with more force, causing Vaughn and one or more of the officers to fall down a flight of stairs. Vaughn struck his head and face on the ground. He was then arrested and denied treatment for his injuries for several hours. The officers later falsely claimed they felt imminent danger upon seeing Vaughn alone outside the apartment.

Shortly after van der Vant moved into her home, she decided to erect a fence around the perimeter of her property. When the officers who live around her learned of her plans they complained and protested. The plaintiff put up her fence anyway, and since then the officers have harassed her. The harassment has included officers putting empty ticket envelopes on van der Vant’s vehicle when it was parked outside her home and issuing complaints and threats over her barking dog. In one instance, Officer Hallinan got a call from an unknown officer who lived on van der Vant’s block complaining about her dog. Hallinan and Officers Aviles and Davis headed to the plaintiff's home and entered her fenced-off yard without permission to remove the collar from her dog's neck. Soon after, the plaintiff called her dog into her home and noticed the collar was missing. The next day she filed a police report for the missing collar. Hallinan called the plaintiff's husband later that day to say the collar had been recovered and was ready to be picked up at the Jefferson Park police station. It was urgent that it be picked up or the collar would not be available for several weeks, Hallinan said. Van der Vant’s husband called her and asked her to pick up the collar on her way home from work. When the plaintiff arrived at the station she asked for Hallinan, who requested her identification. After she presented her identification, officers surrounded the plaintiff and arrested her without justification on suspicion of animal abuse. Three veterinarians examined the plaintiff's dog after her arrest and concluded the dog was in good health. While she was in police custody and handcuffed for hours to a steel bench, van der Vant’s sciatica flared up, requiring hospitalization. The charges against van der Vant were later dismissed during a bench trial.

Clark saw officers use excessive force against the people in the car in front of her and began to record the scene on her cellphone. Soon after, news reporters arrived and asked Clark what she had seen. When Clark agreed to speak with the reporters, one of the officers approached Clark and told her she was not allowed to speak to the media. The officer then escorted Clark to a police car, sat her in the backseat and closed the door. She was detained there for about 30 minutes.

Another person in the holding cell told a supervising officer that James needed medical help and he was taken to a hospital. James refused medical treatment, but he was restrained, drugged and had a catheter inserted into his penis. Officers claimed James was a danger to himself and others and took him to a hospital, where medical personnel said James was cooperative and lucid and discharged him.

Officer Guzman opened the driver’s door and pulled Warren out. Officers Vasselli and Hilliard arrived and officers searched Warren, finding no weapons, drugs or anything illegal. Even so, Warren was ordered to walk over to one of the police cars and place his hands on the hood. The officers searched his car and found nothing suspicious, then began to search Warren a second time, ordering him to loosen his belt and lower his pants so they could search his underwear and genital area for drugs. Officers found nothing illegal, but handcuffed Warren anyway, took his car keys and opened the trunk. Police found an unloaded handgun stored in a closed case that belonged to his girlfriend, a licensed security guard. Officers ignored Warren’s comments that his girlfriend, who was not far from the scene, had the legal documentation for the gun and took him to a police station. His girlfriend came to the station with the documentation, but officers also ignored her and charged Warren with gun possession. The case was dismissed after the judge ruled that the officers had stopped and arrested Warren without probable cause.

The officers had a warrant for a white male named "Tommy" for possession of marijuana. No one by that name had ever lived at the plaintiffs' home or had any connection to them. Janelle Tosado was behind the front door when officers broke it down, and she was pinned to the ground by it. As officers entered the home they pointed guns at the plaintiffs. Because they were not in patrol uniforms and wearing masks, Erendida Tosado and Carlos Tosado first thought officers were criminals invading their home. Officers then searched the plaintiff's home, garage and car, damaged their property and kicked the family dog even after realizing Tommy didn't live there. The officers eventually left without filing charges or issuing any citations to the plaintiffs. On their way out, officers threatened to return and arrest Carlos Tosado if the plaintiffs filed a complaint about what had happened.

The officers walked over to Yates-Evans, shined a flashlight on his face and asked for his identification. Yates-Evans gave the officers his ID, told them he lived there and asked them to lower the flashlight. The officers ignored him, and Yates-Evans asked for their badge numbers. The officers then came into his yard, and one of them pointed a gun at Yates-Evans and told him to run. Yates-Evans ran into his home and police followed him. The noise woke up Yates-Evans’ mother, who walked outside. As Yates-Evans tried to take her back inside, police grabbed him to arrest him. Yates-Evans was trapped behind patio furniture on the porch as police began slapping and pulling at him and threatening to use a Taser on him. Police hit him on the head and he fell to the ground, and officers then dragged him from the porch to the yard and handcuffed him. Officers charged Yates-Evans with assault and resisting a police officer. He was later found not guilty.

Kilpatrick Ave.	-87.7444808999999992	41.9335074000000034	Miranda witnessed a shooting while out walking with a friend in the Belmont Cragin neighborhood. She rushed to assist multiple victims and reported the shooting to a 911 dispatcher. Later, when interviewed by police, Miranda described in detail what she saw and emphasized that she could not identify the shooter because she did not see his face. Despite this, she received intense pressure by officers to identify the shooter. Miranda refused to sign anything identifying a shooter because she did not want to implicate an innocent person. Because of this officers harassed Miranda, accused her of lying and brought her into a police station without justification in order to coerce her into signing a false statement. While at the station officers hit her, denied her access to a phone and called her names. She was later released without any charges; she went to a hospital to get treatment for her injuries.

Bello denied being drunk, but complied when officers ordered him out of the car for field sobriety tests and a Breathalyzer test. Bello’s behavior did not indicate that he was intoxicated; the Breathalyzer showed that his blood alcohol level was under the legal limit. Despite these results, officers impounded and towed Bello’s car. One of the officers, Brittain, told Bello that the case would be thrown out, but he was still going to jail and would be charged with DUI. Bello’s fiancée was left on the side of the road when he was arrested. Bello had to pay $2,160 to get his car from the impound lot. After the officers failed to appear at several court hearings, Bello was found not guilty of the DUI charges.

As he did so, Officer Bikulcius, who was driving an unmarked Lexus, honked his horn at Stepney. Bikulcius yelled, “Pick a lane motherf**ker” and continued to honk at Stepney. Stepney called out to Bikulcius, “Do you want me to pull over?” and Bikulcius responded by gunning his engine, as if he were going to run into Stepney’s car. Stepney pulled over when he saw video cameras on the front of a store, hoping to catch whatever happened next on camera. Bikulcius pulled up next to Stepney’s car, and Stepney got out and flagged down a man he recognized as an off-duty Cook County Sheriff’s Deputy, who had been driving behind Stepney. The deputy pulled over, and Stepney pointed at Bikulcius and said, “He’s acting crazy, and watch out because he’s strapped.” The deputy drew a pistol and Bikulcius got out of his car and drew a pistol as well. They aimed their weapons at one another, and Stepney, fearing for his life, yelled to the deputy, “Shoot him.” Bikulcius identified himself as a Chicago police officer, pointed his gun at Stepney and said, “He’s under arrest.” Bikulcius did not respond when Stepney asked what he was being charged with. As Bikulcius put Stepney in handcuffs, he dislocated Stepney’s right shoulder and fractured Stepney’s left wrist.

While in custody, Waller asked several times for medication for a pre-existing psychological condition and was told that he would be taken to the hospital. After several hours, Waller began to scream and ask for the medication. Police placed him in an individual cell. An officer told Waller that he would be given an I-bond and allowed to leave if he could walk out of the station on his own, but that he would be charged with assault if an ambulance had to be called. Shortly after that, Waller was given an I-bond and told to walk as far away from the station as he could. Outside the station, Waller collapsed and was taken to the hospital, where he was treated for facial fractures and a broken nose.

Officer Messina and another officer pushed Klyzek face-first onto an upholstered chair; Messina and Officer Stoppa shoved her face into the chair. Messina then held a hand over her mouth and nose, restricting her breathing. Officers kneed her, struck her and grabbed Klyzek by the neck. Officer Di Pasquale shouted to her: “I’ll put you in a UPS box and send you back to wherever the f**k you came from.” A surveillance camera mounted inside the salon recorded that exchange and the entire incident. Once officers noticed the cameras they tried looking for the recording inside the business. They didn't realize the surveillance system stored the recordings off site. Klyzek was charged with aggravated battery of a police officer, transported to the police station for processing, then taken to the hospital for medical treatment, where she was diagnosed with multiple contusions. After viewing the video recording, the State’s Attorney’s Office dismissed the charges against her.

Vasquez went over to open the door for him but Lobianco kicked it in. Once inside Lobianco threw Vasquez to the ground and officers began beating him with batons and kicking him. After the beating, officers charged Vasquez with resisting arrest and domestic battery. His girlfriend told officers that Vasquez had not been violent towards her, but they coerced her into going to a police station and signing a criminal complaint against him, by telling her that if she signed it he would be released from custody. Officers took Vazquez to a hospital to treat his injuries and then to Cook County Jail. Vazquez was found not guilty at a bench trial.

On many occasions, without warning or notice, unknown Chicago Police officers and Streets and Sanitation workers ordered residents to move and forbade them from taking all of their personal property with them, which was then thrown away. They used arrest or the threat of arrest to deprive homeless people of their property. This practice violates a settlement in a 1999 lawsuit, in which the city agreed that it would not remove the property of homeless people from Lower Wacker Drive without posting notices 24 hours in advance and providing temporary locations where the individuals could leave their possessions during a cleaning. The sweeps often result in the loss of important personal items and documents, medication, toiletries, clothes, and blankets, requiring the homeless individuals to face nights without protection from the cold, or to skip meals or undergo extreme hardship. (Editor's note: This lawsuit resulted in an agreement by the city to change its policy regarding cleanings of Lower Wacker Drive. The new policy requires regular weekly off-street cleanings of Lower Wacker Drive to be conducted with personnel from the Department of Family and Support Services, provided for 24 hour notice before these cleanings, and prevented police from discarding certain personal items, such as documents, photographs, and medication, during cleanings, except in emergency situations. However, the policy also placed restrictions on the types and amount of personal property that homeless people in that area can have.)

While they were talking, Officer Heard approached the group and told everyone to move. Patton told the officer that he would move, but that he needed to go into the store to purchase some items. Heard insisted that Patton leave the premises, and in response, drew his nightstick. Patton asked the officer why he had drawn his nightstick when they were all complying with his command. Heard told Patton to move now, proceeded to put his nightstick away, grabbed Patton and pushed him into the vestibule of the store. Inside the vestibule, Heard grabbed Patton’s neck with both hands and began to choke him. The officer slapped Patton, punched him in the stomach, and then grabbed him by the collar of his shirt and smashed his head twice into the vestibule’s metal door. Heard reiterated that Patton needed to leave. Patton walked out of the store after being told that he would not be arrested, and called for an ambulance. While at the hospital, a police sergeant met with Patton and opened an internal investigationafter hearing what had happened. Patton gave a recorded statement to the Independent Police Review Authority, and photographs of his injuries were taken.

Officer Najm told Darko to leave the area, and Darko explained he was waiting for his friend to return. Najm got out of the SUV and tried to open Darko’s driver side door while Najm’s partner pulled the SUV directly in front of Darko’s car. Darko provided Najm his license and insurance, and Najm asked him to completely lower his driver side window. When Darko did not lower the window, Najm struck the window with a baton several times. The other officer then exited the SUV and approached Darko with a gun drawn. Darko raised his hands and lowered the driver side window more. Najm reached into Darko’s car and unlocked the car doors as other police officers arrived on the scene. \nThe officers forcibly removed Darko from the car as Najm punched him in the face. They began to kick him, strike him and at one point called him an animal. The officers searched Darko’s car and took him to a hospital. Darko was then put in lockup at a police station until he was released later that day. Darko was falsely charged with battery to a police officer and resisting arrest, but all criminal charges were dismissed.

Acevedo questioned the friends, and they complied. The officer began shouting at R.S. when he did not produce his identification quickly enough. R.S. revealed that he did not have identification on him. Acevedo continued to shout at R.S., threatening, “Without an ID, we wouldn’t be able to identify your body if you turn up dead in the street.” Alarmed at the comment, R.S. attempted to get away from the officer by running down the alley. Acevedo returned to his car and pursued R.S., while his partner chased R.S. on foot. R.S. then ran into a fence and began to climb it when Acevedo got out of his car and drew his gun. R.S. fell to the ground and faced the officer. Acevedo shot at R.S. three times, hitting him once in the arm and once in the thigh. The officer told R.S. to “shut the f**k up” as he lay injured on the ground. Acevedo gave false statements to other officers as they arrived at the scene, telling them R.S. was about to strike him with a wooden board so he shot in fear.

Max weighed about 45 pounds and had never attacked anyone. Max ran around to the front lawn, and S.R. ran after him to return him to the backyard. From about three feet away, Officer Kumiga shot Max eight times, killing the puppy in front of S.R. Kumiga claimed the puppy was chasing his son, who was riding a bicycle down the block, but there was no child on a bicycle near Maglaya’s home. Shortly after, other police officers arrived and incorrectly fined Maglaya’s husband for having the puppy off-leash and for not having a dog tag. The husband was not Max’s owner, but was present at the scene. A few days before the incident, Kumiga had intimidated Maglaya’s husband by threatening to shoot Max if Kumiga saw him off the leash again. Officer McGlade, who arrived shortly after the incident, told Maglaya’s landlord that Maglaya’s family should not have had the puppy and should not live in their neighborhood because of their race and Section 8 housing status. McGlade told the landlord that Maglaya should not have a “nigger dog,” referred to Maglaya as a “spic” and asked why “spics” like her were allowed in the neighborhood. When Maglaya went to a police station, the police refused to record her complaint or take her statement.

Boyle ordered Moore out of his vehicle and told him he “looked like a drug dealer.” The officer asked Moore if he had any weapons on him. Even after Moore denied having them, Boyle searched his car without consent. When Moore objected to the search, Boyle responded, “If you don’t like it, do something about it.” Moore was released when the officers found no weapons. On a separate occasion, Moore was stopped without probable cause while driving near South Pulaski Road and 5th Avenue. This time, after Moore pulled over to the curb, a police car swerved in front of his SUV and officers surrounded the car with guns drawn. Moore had a passenger in the car and the police aimed their guns at Moore and his passenger. Sergeant Griffin said, “Don’t reach or I’ll shoot.” Moore was ordered out of his car and was searched. When he asked why he was stopped, Boyle said, “Shut the f**k up!” Moore was then handcuffed and his socks and shoes were taken. Boyle asked Moore, “Do you remember me?” Boyle and Officer Velez then searched Moore’s car without his consent. Despite Moore’s innocence, Boyle bragged to the another officer that she was going to arrest Moore because “He is on parole and it’s gonna stick.” Officers charged Moore with unlawful use of a weapon, possession of a controlled substance and other criminal offenses. Moore’s false arrest resulted in his parole being revoked, and he was incarcerated. The arrest also cost Moore his job and custody of his children. The state later dismissed the charges.

Unbeknownst to Sperling, he'd been under surveillance by the Chicago Police Department for suspected drug activities. During the traffic stop, officers told Sperling he'd failed to use a turn signal, which was a false pretext for the stop. Pruente, a Chicago police officer, and a Glenview officer handcuffed him, put him in a squad car and searched his vehicle without asking him any questions. Earlier that day, CPD officers had asked that the Glenview officers who were assisting them, turn off the audio and video systems in their squad cars so Sperling's traffic stop would not be recorded. But the CPD officers were unaware that one of the Glenview squad cars' recording capabilities had not been disabled, and the entire encounter was documented. During the search of Sperling's vehicle, Pruente found a bag containing illegal drugs and filed felony drug charges against Sperling. At a criminal hearing, Officers Morgan and Pruente and Sgt. Padar, of CPD, and two Glenview officers lied under oath, unaware of the existence of the Glenview squad car video. They said Sperling was asked for his driver's license and insurance and that he told officers he had marijuana in his vehicle before they handcuffed him. The video of the traffic stop was then shown in the court, refuting what the officers had just said. The criminal court judge said, "There's strong evidence it was a conspiracy to lie in this case, for everyone to come up with the same lie." The criminal charges against Sperling were dismissed.

Two plainclothes officers removed Douglas and Ford from the car and searched them. One of the officers pulled up Douglas’ shirt and searched down the front of his pants. Soon after, two additional plainclothes officers approached, and one removed Halley from the car. The officers continued to search the interior of the car for several minutes, and they forced a handcuffed Douglas to walk backward off the street and across a yard to the side of a nearby home. The officers shackled one of Douglas’ wrists to a window bar on the home, pulled his pants down to his ankles, bent him over and searched his buttocks. When the officers realized a neighbor was watching, they put Douglas into the back of the squad car with Ford, put Halley back in Douglas’ car and relocated to an alley behind a church. There, Officer Wherfel ordered Halley, who was surrounded by five male officers, to get out of the car and remove her pants. Halley pleaded with Wherfel, explaining that she was menstruating and was using a tampon. Wherfel uncuffed one of Halley’s hands and ordered her to remove the tampon. She tearfully removed the tampon, and Wherfel used her fingers to probe Halley’s vagina while the male officers looked on, commenting on Halley’s body. When nothing illegal was found on Halley’s person, Wherfel bent down, reached toward her own sock and stood up holding a small bag of heroin, announcing that she had found it in Halley’s waistband. The officers then falsely charged Douglas and Halley for delivery and possession of drugs. The charges against Douglas were dropped upon his death a month later.

Officer Buford reached through the sunroof of Rashan’s car and pulled him up. Other officers dragged Rashan out, threw him to the pavement, beat him, searched his car and strip-searched him. Police found no drugs, but they took Rashan to a police station, where Officer Bozek threatened to tase him if he did not submit to a body-cavity search. After the second search failed to turn up drugs, Bozek told Rashan that he “shouldn’t be in this country anyway” and ought to return to where he came from. Police filed false reports claiming that narcotics were found in Rashan’s car, and he was charged with possession of a controlled substance. The charges were later dropped.

He was walking across a parking lot when three unmarked police cars drove up and officers got out. One of them, Officer Jones, fired a shot, sending the crowd running. Startled by the shot, Glaze also ran; Jones chased him and fired at him several times. Officer Garcia chased Glaze in one of the unmarked police cars and also fired at him. Glaze was hit in his upper left arm and left thigh. Officers searched Glaze and found no weapons, then took him to a hospital, where he was tied to his bed. Police catalogued Glaze’s belongings, which included a black iPhone, an ID card, keys and money. No firearm was found, but to justify felony charges against Glazer and their shooting of him, police claimed that he had threatened them with a silver firearm. They planted a silver Samsung phone among his recovered belongings. Police said the silver phone could have been mistaken for a gun and charged Glaze with aggravated assault and resisting and obstructing police. He was found not guilty.

The charge was later dismissed.

The two officers got out of the car and ordered Payne to place his hands on a nearby wall. The officers said they had received a call that Payne had been bothering the woman he was with. The woman told the officers that Payne was her friend and their assistance was not needed. Acosta and Jedlink ignored the woman’s repeated comments, handcuffed Payne and forced him into the police car. They arrested Payne on suspicion of domestic battery without asking whether he and the woman lived together or were related. When the officers drafted the complaint, they tried to coerce the woman to sign it. She refused, saying that Payne had done nothing wrong. Acosta signed the report, and he and Jedlink drove Payne to Cook County Jail, where he stayed for two days before he was released on bail. Two weeks later, at Payne’s pretrial hearing, the woman refused to testify against him. The charge of domestic battery was dismissed.

The officers also searched Hill’s socks and pockets, but did not find any illegal items. The officers removed Hill’s driver’s license from his pocket, and when Hill tried to pull his pants back up, the officers grabbed his right arm, twisted his wrist and pulled it far behind his back. Hill heard his wrist pop, and screamed out that he had a prior wrist condition and that he was hurt. The officers ridiculed Hill, handcuffed him, and forced him to wait with his body bent over the police car while they ran his driver’s license. The officers eventually removed the handcuffs and drove away. Many people on the street witnessed the incident, including some of Hill’s neighbors. Hill sought treatment for his wrist injury, which required surgery.

During the divorce process, Kimble-Figueroa was also having an affair with Officer Campbell. Because of this, Officer Campbell abused his police powers in an effort to get Figueroa to give up visitation and custody rights of his children. In one instance, Officer Campbell eavesdropped on a phone conversation Figueroa was having with Kimble-Figueroa about their children. During the call, Officer Campbell grabbed the phone from Kimble-Figueroa, identified himself as a Chicago police officer, and threatened Figueroa with arrest if he didn't fully cooperate with her during the divorce. The following day, Figueroa went to his wife's home to drop off his children. Officer Campbell was standing with other unknown officers in full uniform, blocking Figueroa's path to the building's entrance. Officer Campbell told Figueroa he'd been called to supervise the transfer of the children. This was a lie, because there was no complaint or court order asking Officer Campbell to be there. The following week, Figueroa picked up his children from his wife's home and took them to a museum. When he brought his children home, Officer Campbell and unknown officers arrested Figueroa without justification and charged him with phone harassment, based on the earlier phone call. Officer Campbell made the arrest and falsified police reports in order to help Kimble-Figueroa in her divorce proceedings. After a criminal trial, Figueroa was found not guilty.

Officer Taylor lives in the same building on the second floor. Taylor was friendly with Acuna and Samuels, until becoming hostile toward them. While on duty, Taylor would harass them with tickets and traffic stops. Taylor became focused on a cable box that she had loaned to Samuels and Acuna a year before. Taylor would bang on their door and demand that they return the cable box. One morning after Acuna had left for work and Samuels was alone with the baby, Taylor and her teenage son began banging loudly at the front door. Samuels was afraid to open the door. Taylor proceeded to cut off the power to Samuels’ apartment, hoping that the July heat would force her out. Ten minutes after the power was shut off, Samuels was able to reach the building’s maintenance person to restore the power. Taylor turned the power off again. This time, Samuels was not able to reach the maintenance person and was forced to run down to the basement, leaving her infant son alone in a high chair. When Samuels entered the basement, Taylor, her teenage son and Officer Kirk confronted her. Taylor demanded Samuels’ keys, and struck Samuels in the face several times. Kirk punched her several times. Samuels tried to run into her apartment, but Kirk shoved her into a door and punched her on the face, causing a split lip and a large gash on her head. She was put in a chokehold, handcuffed and dragged down the stairs into the foyer. When additional officers arrived at the scene, Kirk stated that he was an off-duty officer trying to arrest a woman who had battered two officers. The arriving officers told Samuels that she was being arrested and allowed her to wait with her son while her sister and husband arrived. She was taken to the police station, and after pleading for medical treatment was taken to the hospital. She was charged with two misdemeanor complaints of battery. When Acuna went to the police station to see his wife, Kirk confronted and arrested him for misdemeanor assault on an officer.

Hondras' boyfriend asked the officers why he was being stopped and asked for a police supervisor to come to the scene. Furqan and Granville responded by banging on the car's window with batons. When Hondras' boyfriend rolled down the window to speak to an apparent supervisor, a uniformed officer reached through the open window, unlocked the driver's side door and dragged the boyfriend out of the car. McGhee then pulled Hondras out of the car, bruising her arm. McGhee searched Hondras and her purse and didn't find anything illegal. The officer told Hondras she was "not under arrest," yet placed her in handcuffs in the back of a squad car. The officers brought Hondras and her boyfriend to a police station, where Hondras was handcuffed to a wall. After about an hour, one of the officers released Hondras and returned her purse. But as Hondras left the station, Officer Sajdak saw her and took her purse again, handcuffed her, and accused her of having drugs. He brought her back in the station and, in front of Hondras' boyfriend, suggested that she needed a body-cavity search. McGhee performed a strip search of the plaintiff in a bathroom with no door on it. McGhee put her hands inside Hondras' shirt, pulled up her bra and used a wand to look into her pants. Then she had Hondras remove her pants and panties, squat, and cough multiple times. Hondras cried as McGhee told her to "cough harder." Nothing illegal was found on or inside her body or her belongings. Officers again released Hondras without charges. Her boyfriend remained in custody and was charged with traffic violations.

Although more than 20 neighbors told the officers she was autistic and had significant cognitive impairments, the officers arrested McGill. The officers handled McGill roughly during the arrest, fracturing her neck when one of them put his knee in the back of her neck, putting handcuffs on her so tight that the cuffs punctured her skin, and dragging her into the police car. McGill was held at the station for several hours without medical treatment but was not charged with any crime. Her family later took her to Mt. Sinai Hospital for treatment. The arrest was so traumatic that McGill, who after years of work with teachers and counselors had been able to interact with strangers, became afraid to leave her home or talk to people other than her family.

Barksdale-Sullers, who suffers from a fainting condition, became upset and collapsed; one officer kicked and pulled her by her coat while she was on the ground. The officers ordered McWilliams to get inside a marked police sport-utility vehicle. He could not comply because of the height of the vehicle and the fact that his hands were handcuffed behind his back. The officers then accused him of resisting arrest and shot him twice with a Taser gun, causing him to fall to the ground. McWilliams has a heart condition, and was afraid the shocks would affect the functioning of his heart. He was taken to the hospital for treatment and released back to the police. He was charged with DUI, resisting arrest and various traffic offenses. His car was also impounded and not returned. These charges were eventually dismissed.

Cook had encountered Eng on the streets in his neighborhood, including at the gas station where the robbery occurred. As a result, Cook was charged with burglary and spent six weeks at Cook County Jail before posting bond. He was found not guilty of the charge.

The officers parked behind the station, where they punched Khaled and Khrawish in the face and body numerous times and questioned them about their nationality; both Khaled and Khrawish are U.S. citizens. Once inside the police station, officers told Khaled and Khrawish that they would have to wait till the next day to get medical attention and gave them wet napkins to clean themselves with before they were locked up. Khrawish was later treated for back and neck spasms. Both men were charged with obstructing traffic, but the charges were later dropped.

Lakeshore Dr.	-87.6141755000000018	41.8900093999999967	Izsak anchored his 57-foot yacht, The Flying Lady, in Lake Michigan's "play pen," near Ohio Street Beach. He had 20 friends on board and was playing music when officers pulled alongside him in a police boat. The officers told Izsak they were investigating a noise violation and demanded to see his identification and the yacht's paperwork. Izsak turned down the music and complied. Without permission, Officer Funchion jumped onto The Flying Lady and said he needed to inspect the safety of the yacht. The hull of the yacht facing the police boat had a sticker showing that the Coast Guard had already inspected The Flying Lady at the beginning of the boating season. Izsak also gave officers paperwork showing his yacht had passed the Coast Guard's highest level of safety standards. Officer Funchion ignored this and continued his inspection while repeatedly asking Izsak how he could afford the yacht in front of his guests. During the inspection, Officer Funchion asked Izsak if he had anything illegal on The Flying Lady. Izsak said he did not, but Officer Funchion claimed that he knew there was something illegal and he was going to find it. He ransacked the yacht's bedroom, drawers and cabinets without justification. When nothing illegal was found, Officer Funchion falsely claimed Vosatka spit on him in order to threaten to impound the boat and arrest them. He then grabbed Vosatka, 68, and handcuffed him. Officers roughly moved Vosatka on to the police boat. They searced his pockets and took his car keys and a cell phone case, which were never returned. Vosatka, who had a medical condition that made it difficult to sit for long periods of time, tried to stand up, but officers pushed him back down, breaking his glasses. Vosatka refused to sign a ticket for an ordinance violation, so officers took him to a police station and charged with reckless conduct. After approximately four court appearances, the charge was dismissed.

On his way to the second shift, Milan picked up two friends. Meanwhile, police were in the area looking for suspects in a gun-related case and pulled Milan and his friends over, took them out of the SUV, handcuffed them and searched the SUV. When an officer who had met Milan recognized him and confirmed his statement that he was a licensed security guard, Sgt. Cascone told Milan he was free to go but one of the passengers had to drive the SUV since Milan’s driver’s license was suspended. But officers Marcus and Salyers instead arrested Milan on gun charges, had him unlock the floor compartment and took Milan's gun case, security guard credentials, licenses and FOID card. They then drove him to a police station, where he was chained to a wall for hours and Marcus pointed a gun at his head. Marcus and Salyers filed false reports stating that Milan's gun was not secured and he was not employed by a licensed security company. The charges were dismissed. Milan got his security guard credentials back but his gun was destroyed. His FOID card was canceled because of the arrest and he was later rearrested on other gun charges. Those charges were also dismissed.

Officer Hernandez stepped out of the squad car and requested that Lester come over to her. Lester asked why he was being stopped. The officer ignored his question and approached him, while Lester backed away. Hernandez grabbed Lester’s wrist, and Lester asked why he was being grabbed. Without warning, Officer Cravens, who was also in the squad car, ran up to Lester and tased him in the chest. The officers handcuffed Lester and placed him inside the squad car. He was taken to the police station and charged with assault of a police officer and battery. At the station, Cravens bragged to the other officers that he was finally able to use his Taser and laughed about using it on Lester. Lester complained of chest pains and requested medical treatment. The officers attempted to talk him out of receiving treatment, and after several hours in custody, Lester was finally taken to the emergency room. He was treated and released back into police custody. He was found not guilty of these charges.

Coleman had been involved in an accident earlier that day and believed his car was located in the station’s rear parking. Diggins went into the station with her mother while Coleman waited outside. They encountered Officer Jones, who began to yell at them, telling them to leave the station and using foul language. Diggins complied while her mother stayed inside the station. Diggins waited outside with Coleman for 45 minutes. Then Jones exited the station and confronted Diggins and Coleman. He screamed at them and threatened to arrest them. Diggins again explained that they only wanted information about Coleman’s car. Diggins and Coleman tried to leave the station, and without reason or provocation, Jones punched Diggins in the face, knocking her to the ground. As Jones and an unknown female officer restrained Diggins on the ground, Officer Portis sprayed her with pepper spray. At the same time, Officer Wells and other officers grabbed, punched and restrained Coleman. The officers took both of them to holding cells and refused to give them bandages or paper towels for their wounds. As Diggins lay on the cell’s floor, an officer threw liquid on her, which she believed to be urine. Diggins was taken to the hospital after several hours in custody; Coleman never received treatment. Diggins had learned she was pregnant a few days before the arrest, but after getting tested at the hospital, she found out that she had miscarried because of the injuries she suffered during the arrest. Coleman and Diggins were charged with battery, assault, resisting a police officer and trespassing.

Once the ambulance came, the officers prohibited paramedics from attending to Jamale. Carroll and several neighbors shouted at the officers and paramedics that he was asthmatic, 16 years old and “dying.” After 10 to 20 minutes, the officers finally allowed the paramedics to assist Jamale. He spent several days at Holy Cross Hospital. The other two Carradine boys were also treated there after the incident, following their arrest and brief detention but ultimate release, free of criminal charges.

Feeling coerced and vulnerable, Norwood was sexually abused by Officer Stewart. After this first incident, Norwood was arrested four more times for offenses that included soliciting rides on the public way, soliciting unlawful business and prostitution.

Michigan Ave.	-87.6208814999999959	41.7327471999999986	In May 2010, Triplett, a college student, had just ridden his bike to the alley entrance behind his godmother’s home near 89th Street and Michigan Avenue when a man ran toward him and pulled out a gun as Triplett was going through the back gate. Afraid, Triplett ran away. But as he crossed a neighbor’s yard to try and reach his godmother’s front door, an officer jumped out of a police car on Michigan and ordered Triplett to get on the ground. Triplett told the officer, “You’ve got the wrong guy, the guy with a gun is in the alley.” But the officer arrested Triplett anyway, and as he was waiting in the back of the squad car other officers came up, including an off-duty officer Triplett recognized as a resident of the neighborhood. The off-duty officer told Triplett, “You’re breaking into houses now, I should break your face.” Triplett then heard the group of officers talking with the man who had pulled a gun on him, and realized the incident was about an attempted break-in of a home on 89th Street. The officers took Triplett to a police station and tried to convince him to admit to the crime. Triplett refused. He was held overnight and charged with criminal trespass. At Triplett’s first court date, he was offered one year’s probation in exchange for a guilty plea, but refused and said he hadn’t committed any crime and was given a June 2010 trial date. Meanwhile, police conspired to implicate Triplett for the burglary of Officer Howard’s home; Howard’s home was a few miles from the home on 89th Street where the May 2010 attempted break-in took place. The morning of Triplett’s trial for the May 2010 burglary, three officers came to his home to arrest him for the Howard burglary, falsely claiming to have a warrant, using “foul and abusive language” and entering the home even though they were told Triplett wasn’t there. Later that morning, the May 2010 case against Triplett was dismissed, but he was re-arrested for the Howard burglary as he left the courthouse. Police claimed that the physical evidence -- fingerprints and DNA -- pointed to Triplett, even though the fingerprints didn’t match and Triplett had never provided a DNA sample to police. Triplett couldn’t make bond in the case, however, and ended up spending two months in Cook County Jail before the charges were dropped.

The Pandolfis believed that the brothers, Justin and Robert Stanaker, had failed to complete the work they had agreed to do in February 2010. One day in April 2010, Robert Stanaker called the police while he and Justin were standing outside the Pandolfis' apartment, claiming that he needed assistance. When Officers Syfczak and Eitel arrived, the brothers told them that they had tools inside the apartment they wanted to retrieve. While standing with the officers, one of the brothers called Richard Pandolfi, who explicitly told them they didn't have permission to enter his apartment. Despite that, under the supervision of the officers, the Stanakers entered the apartment, using a key the Pandolfis had given them to use while they were remodeling. The officers and the Stanakers forced their way into the apartment, despite not having a search warrant or probable cause. As they entered, Richard Pandolfi tried to block them and Justin Stanaker knocked Richard Pandolfi to the ground. Pandolfi pushed Stanaker off of him, which cased Stanaker to fall back and bump into Officer Eitel. When the officers and Stanaker brothers refused to leave their home, Richard Pandolfi told his wife to call 911. At that point, Officer Syfczak placed Richard Pandolfi under arrest and transported him to the 23rd District police station. Stacey Pandolfi remained in the house with Officer Eitel and the Stanakers, and pleaded with them to leave her home. Instead, Officer Eitel allowed the Stanakers to ransack the apartment, flipping the furniture over, ripping several doors off the hinges, and throwing their childrens' toys and other personal belongings around the house. Officer Eitel called Pandolfi a "crazy lady" and said they could, "do anything that we want." The Stanakers then stole a set of keys from the kitchen and used them to break into the Pandolfis' home office in the garden unit of the building. They also searched the Panolfis' garage and their car. During this time, Sergeant Chevalier, Officer Eitel's supervisor, arrived and allowed the search to continue. They also allowed the Stanakers to remove numerous items from the apartment and garage, without inventorying them. Richard Pandolfi was charged with misdemeanor battery to Justin Stanaker, aggravated battery to a police officer, and resisting arrest. The battery charge was dropped, but he was found guilty at trial of aggravated battery to a police officer and resisting arrest.

As the cars headed west on 79th Street and turned left to go south on Vincennes Avenue, Officer London, who was in uniform but driving her personal vehicle, cut through the procession. Green pointed to the sticker on the windshield and raised her voice at London as she and Fisher continued onto Vincennes Avenue. London followed and called 911 to report she was in distress. Near West 100th Place and South Vincennes Avenue, a group of officers, including London and Officer Williams, pulled over Green, Fisher and Jones. The officers pointed their guns at them and yelled “Put your f**king hands in the air.” The officers handcuffed Green, Fisher and Jones and searched them and their cars for at least 45 minutes while London accused Green of battery. The officers took Fisher’s identification, and Green missed her sister’s burial. The officers returned to a police station and falsified reports claiming Green had hit London with a bottle. Meanwhile, when Fisher went to the same station to retrieve his identification, London and others placed him in handcuffs and locked him up until the next day. Green called the Independent Police Review Authority to report the incident, and an investigator told Green he would obtain the Police Observation Device camera recordings of the incident. The police did not provide the recordings before the trial. Under oath, London stated that Green threw a bottle at her and hit her in the face. The charges against Fisher and Jones were dropped, but the judge found Green guilty of battery. After Green was convicted, the police released the camera recordings. The recordings showed that the charges against Green were false and London had lied on the witness stand. London was found guilty for falsely testifying, and Green’s battery conviction was vacated.

One officer instructed him to get out of the vehicle. Leslie explained that he was unable to exit without assistance because he had injured his back earlier that morning and was experiencing severe pain and numbness in both of his legs. One of the officers then asked if there were any weapons in the vehicle. Leslie said no and the officer unbuckled Leslie's seatbelt. Officers Rodriguez and Proano then arrived on the scene and Officer Rodriguez told Leslie there was nothing wrong with him. Leslie again explained his injuries and argued with Officer Rodriguez. Officer Rodriguez then grabbed Leslie by his jacket, yanked him out of the vehicle, threw him to the ground, handcuffed him and searched him. Leslie again complained about his disabilities while Officer Rodriguez aggressively put him in his squad car and took him to a police station. Once there Leslie requested medical attention and asked what he'd been arrested for. Officer Rodriguez responded by placing him in a choke hold.

The officer then grabbed Webber by the hair and smashed his face into the ground several times, bloodying his forehead and lip. “You shouldn’t get so smart,” one of the officers said. “I was just going to give you some tickets, but now I’m going to take you to jail.” The officers arrested Webber, handcuffed him and placed him in the back of the squad car. At the station, an officer offered Webber a band-aid for his injures, but refused to take him to the hospital for treatment. Webber was charged with several traffic offenses and for resisting a peace officer. He was held in the station lockup for 10 hours before being released. The charges were later dismissed.

Officer Coleman pulled him out of his car and handcuffed him. Officer Ugarte told Jennings that he would "make things much easier" on him if he revealed the location of contraband. When Jennings said he didn't know about any, Ugarte pulled an unknown substance out of his pocket and then arrested Jennings and charged him with possession of a controllef substance. Officers Ugarte and Coleman filed false reports to support the charge. Jennings filed a complaint against Officer Ugarte, but it was determined to be "unfounded." In October 2010, a few blocks away from the car wash, Jennings was in his vehicle, at a stoplight, when Officers Ugarte and Vivanco drove up, pulled him out of his car, and handcuffed him. Ugarte said he had been looking for him ever since he filed the complaint over the June incident. The officers arrested Jennings and charged him with possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute. While in the holding cell at the police station, Officer Harris said, "I knew we'd get you, bitch."

Once stopped, Lewis removed his keys from the ignition. As Officers Liebhaber and Matysiak walked towards Lewis's car a second squad car arrived at the scene and an unknown officer got out. Officers Liebhaber and Matysiak asked for Lewis' license and insurance. Lewis said he had insurance but no license. Officers yanked Lewis out of the car, causing his phone and keys to fall to the ground. The unknown officer picked them up and Lewis asked for his phone back. The unknown officer said, "No, you f**king idiot. This is my phone now," before driving off with Lewis' phone and keys. Officers Liebhaber and Matysiak handcuffed Lewis and searched his car. Officers found nothing illegal in the car and then asked Lewis where they could find guns or drugs. Lewis told them he didn't know anything and as officers were about to release him they realized his keys were missing. When officers couldn't find the keys they began to aggressively search Lewis and demand he tell them where the keys were. Officer Liebhaber began punching Lewis, who was still handcuffed, in the stomach while yelling about the missing keys. Lewis told Officer Liebhaber the unknown officer drove off earlier with his keys and phone. Officer Liebhaber stopped punching Lewis and made a call. The unknown officer returned but only gave Officer Liebhaber Lewis' phone because he'd thrown away the car keys. The unknown officer left. Lewis was afraid officers were going to kill him because of their earlier mistreatment of him and began screaming for help. Officers Liebhaber and Matysiak quickly got into their squad car and drove away with Lewis. Lewis kept repeating, "Please officer, don't kill me. I don't want to die." Officer Liebhaber told Lewis to shut up or they'd shut him up. Officers eventually took Lewis to a police station where another officer asked if Lewis wanted to file a complaint against Officers Liebhaber and Matysiak, but he was never given a complaint form or any other means to file a complaint against them.

In December 2008, after Johnson received a $65,000 settlement in a lawsuit, Officers Kemps and Cahill arrested him outside his home, took his house keys and ransacked his home. Johnson was later told that he was being charged with criminal possession of cananbis, which police fabricated. The charge was dismissed. In August 2009, Johnson sued Kemps and Cahill for false arrest. A month later, officers in Halloween masks, including Officers Kerr and Alonso, raided Johnson’s home, claiming they were looking for a gun. They didn't find a gun, but the officers falsely charged Johnson with possession of crack cocaine. The charge was also dismissed.

Uncomfortable with her son meeting a stranger alone, Scruggs walked with him to the store. On the way, Scruggs received a call from her son’s cell phone. She answered and explained to the man on the line that they were on their way to pick up the phone. When they arrived outside the CVS, Scruggs called her son’s phone to tell the man they were there. He said he was inside and was walking toward the front of the store. Officer Cassidy, wearing a dark jacket, suddenly rushed out of the store and grabbed Scruggs’ arms, pushing her backward. Stunned, Scruggs explained she was simply there to pick up her son’s phone. Several police cars and unmarked cars pulled up to the scene, with multiple officers exiting the cars. Cassidy ordered Scruggs to empty her pockets. Scruggs placed her keys, cell phone, driver’s license and insurance card on an unmarked car nearby. The officers looked through her cell phone while Officer Pronek grabbed Scruggs from behind, handcuffed her and arrested her. Scruggs was taken to a police station, held overnight and charged with resisting and obstructing an officer. Because of this incident, Scruggs had difficulty breathing and was taken to a hospital for treatment.

Scruggs later learned the officers outside CVS had used her keys and driver’s license to locate and enter her home, illegally searching it without a warrant or her consent. There, the officers had arrested her son at gunpoint. The case against Scruggs was ultimately dismissed.

The officers' actions included: Officers Anderson, Bogdalek, Lopez and Bard using excessive force against Alberto Martinez, who sustained a massive laceration and bruises on his head and body; Officer Shine or Officer O'Donnell firing a Taser at Alberto Martinez; Officers Shine, Purtell and others using excessive force against Meliton Martinez; Officer Bard spitting on Sofia Martinez and Officers Bogdalek and Bard using excessive force against her; Officer Shine and others using excessive force against Felipe Garcia; and Officers Bard, Castelli, and Kelly falsely arresting and using excessive force against Martin Martinez; and officers falsely arresting Daniel Martinez. At the police station, Officer O'Donnell choked and hit Martin Martinez to try to coerce him into not telling his lawyer about the officers' misconduct. When the lawyer met with Martin, officers remained in the room to intimidate him into silence. Officers then falsified reports in order to file charges against the plaintiffs for drinking in the public way, resisting arrest and other misdemeanors. Once they were released from custody, Alberto, Meliton, and Sofia Martinez went to a hospital because of their injuries. The Chicago Police Department later refused to comply with a court order to turn over evidence from the arrests and instead destroyed records in order to conceal the officers' misconduct. At the criminal trials officers answered "I don't remember" when asked about the circumstances during the arrests. The judge in the criminal case said he was "greatly troubled" by the testimony of Officer Anderson. The charges were later dismissed.

One of the passengers was caught. Cherry was a known associate of one of the passengers, and police detained and interrogated Cherry to ask questions about the hit-and-run homicide, of which he knew nothing. Two months later, Cherry was falsely arrested as an accomplice to an unrelated armed robbery. When taken in for questioning to the CPD Precinct, officers and two prosecutors interrogated Cherry about the hit-and-run case, not the armed robbery for which he had just been arrested. Still unable to provide them with information, he was taken into a lineup, and later told that he was identified by the victims of the robbery. The officers then asked Cherry if there was anything he would like to tell them now that he had been “identified.” Still unable to tell the officers anything, Cherry was charged with armed robbery, burglary, unlawful restraint and unlawful use of a weapon by a felon and was held in the Cook County Department of Corrections until he posted bail a year later. As Cherry awaited trial, the state continued to use the armed robbery charge as a bargaining chip to pressure him into testifying about the homicide. Cherry was found not guilty in December 2010.

Moody tried to run away but was hit by a stray bullet and fell to the ground. Officer Sampson stopped her car and attended to Moody, and both officers called for paramedics and additional police. In their calls to 911, neither officer said Moody had a gun or was involved in the shooting, and Sampson’s original version of the events did not incriminate Moody. However, Sampson later changed her story and claimed that she had seen Moody with a gun. None of the other officers reported the inconsistency to supervisors or detectives. Moody was arrested three hours after the shooting, as he waited for surgery at the hospital, and was charged with multiple weapons offenses. His case remained in court for more than five years and during that time, Sampson changed her story once again and prosecutors re-indicted Moody on more serious charges. Finally, in November 2013, Moody was found not guilty. The deliberation took less than 30 minutes.

Belcher, a 30 year old African-American man, was in his Humboldt Park residence when officers took him to the police station. That same day, in a nearby location, two police officers had been shot and killed while sitting in their parked vehicle. Before his death, one of the officers informed police that there had been three assailants and a maroon car that had fled west after the shooting. Riley and Belcher were both questioned about the homicide and later released. The following day, Riley was contacted by a detective and told to return to the station. A few hours earlier, officers had also demanded that Belcher return. Riley returned to the station with her mother. She was placed in a locked interrogation room and told to implicate Jason Austin. She was coerced to say that she had seen Austin driving in a maroon Buick. Riley informed the officers that she had not seen Austin driving in a maroon Buick the day of the shooting. The detectives shouted obscenities at Riley while threatening her with criminal prosecution if she refused to testify. The detectives informed her that her mother had left the station and could not protect her. Riley was handcuffed to a steel ring on the wall and a male detective slapped her with force across the face, demanding the false statement when she continued to refuse. After enduring other physical assault, Riley agreed to testify. She was released after being detained for over 20 hours. In the adjacent room, Belcher was also being forced to implicate Austin. Belcher informed detectives that he had not seen Austin driving a maroon vehicle, but rather a green minivan. He was handcuffed to the wall and repeatedly hit on the head and body. One of the detectives choked him until he agreed to sign the false statement. He was released after being detained for over 48 hours. Belcher also witnessed detectives assault Riley in the adjacent room.

Lally radioed a police supervisor to come to the scene and order the officers to give him the report number. Sgt. Kaupert arrived at the scene, and instead of directing the officers to prepare a report number for Lally, he belittled Lally in front of the officers and civilian bystanders. Lally told Kaupert that he intended to report him to his watch commander for insubordination. Kaupert ordered that Lally be arrested. Lally was taken to a police station. As a result of his arrest, Lally’s battalion chief car was left unattended at the fire scene and his fire district was unsupervised. At the station, the officers continued to insult him. They confiscated his portable radio and placed him in a cell. After an hour, the acting watch commander, Lt. Gale, took Lally to his office and told him he would not be charged with an offense. Gale urged Lally to lie about the incident by suggesting that Lally say he had “relocated” to the police station voluntarily as part of the fire investigation. Gale drove Lally back to his car and continued to encourage him to cover up the incident, asking if he could obtain Lally’s favorite liquor for him. Lally refused to participate in the cover-up.

They yelled out racial epithets at Richter and his cousin, who are both Latino. Thomas and Fitzgerald dragged Richter and his cousin to the squad car and threw them against it. An adult family member, who had watched what was happening, told the officers that Richter and his cousin had done nothing wrong. One of the officers said they had received a call informing them that drugs were being sold at that address. The officers eventually released Richter and his cousin without explanation and left.

He spotted officers in an unmarked police car a short distance away and attempted to draw their attention to the man in the road. Officers did not stop their vehicle at first so Rodriguez pointed his green laser pointer--which he used for his job with the water and sewer department--at a sign in front of the officers’ vehicle. This caused the officers to arrest Rodriguez and charge him with aggravated assault of a police officer and unlawful use of a weapon. Rodriguez was suffering from three herniated discs in his neck and had recently undergone rotator cuff surgery, so it hurt to put his arms behind his back during the arrest. He told the officers this but they handcuffed him with his hands behind his back, causing him pain and discomfort. The charges were later dismissed.

The first arrest took place in July 2008, when Officers Perez and Mook issued Wright a ticket for excessive noise as he sat in his parked car. Perez then threw Wright against the car and handcuffed him. The two officers took Wright to the 24th District police station, but refused to let him call his lawyer, give him his medication for high blood pressure and back pain, let him see a doctor or give him any food, water or access to the bathroom. The next day, officers took Wright to Cook County Jail, but authorities there refused to jail him because the arrest stemmed from a ticket, not a crime. Back at the 24th District station, a supervisor ordered officers to release Wright. Several months later, the ticket was dismissed and the City of Chicago was ordered to pay Wright back for the costs he incurred from towing and storage of his car after the arrest. Wright later filed a civil rights suit against Perez and Mook. About a year later, in June 2009, Wright was again ticketed for playing his music too loud--this time by two officers, Vanourek and Pietrusiewicz, who worked the same shift as Perez and Mook. Vanourek and Pietrusiewicz again arrested Wright, took him to the police station and impounded and searched his car. This time, Wright was released the same day; the following month, the city dismissed the ticket. Later on the same day the ticket was dismissed, Wright was driving west on Rogers Avenue near Clark Street, when Vanourek and Officer Cerkic made a U-turn, stopped him in a private parking lot on Clark, cited him again for excessive noise--even though the radio in his car wasn’t working--and arrested him. Vanourek shoved Wright into the squad car, hitting Wright’s head on the car. Wright was charged with resisting arrest and spent three days in jail, but was later found not guilty of the charges. In August 2009, Wright was stopped by police once again, this time for allegedly driving his car over the divider line on North Clark. Sgt. Baranowski searched Wright and arrested him for allegedly having a small baggy of marijuana in his front pocket. The case was later dismissed.

He was knocked unconscious several times, and after the third time, felt someone twist his arm behind his back. He turned over and hit the individual in an attempt to escape, not knowing that the individual was Officer Goodwin. In response, Goodwin began to kick and punch Moore, along with the rest of the crowd. Moore informed the officer that he was not resisting arrest, therefore, the officer could stop. The officer did not stop kicking and punching Moore and did not make an attempt to stop the crowd from hitting him, either. A call was placed for crowd control and several more officers arrived at the scene. Officer Martinez and unknown officers witnessed the assault and did nothing to arrest anyone from the crowd or Goodwin. Moore was charged with armed robbery, aggravated battery and resisting arrest. Disciplinary action was not taken against the crowd, or Goodwin, for assaulting him.

Then they walked him to a nearby Chicago Housing Authority complex, where police were conducting a mission to arrest individuals suspected of drug activity. \nThe officers put Keys on a nearby curb, where he sat with several other handcuffed individuals for about 15 minutes. The officers then told Keys he was free to go as soon as they found a device—commonly referred to as a “cutter”—to safely remove the plastic restraint. One of the officers tried to remove Keys’ restraint with a knife, but was unsuccessful. Two other officers tried using knives to cut off the restraint, and on the third attempt Keys’ hands were cut in at least two places, causing him to bleed profusely. \nOnly after another officer was called to bring over a cutter was the restraint removed successfully. Keys was taken to a hospital, where he received stitches in one finger and was treated for nerve damage to other fingers. Keys was released back into police custody, where he was charged with three misdemeanor crimes and three traffic offenses. Haywood filed the reports for the traffic citations, which included failing to wear a seatbelt, driving on a suspended license and operating a car without insurance. Williams and Nash filed the reports for the criminal charges, which included marijuana possession and criminal trespass. \nThe charges against Keys were dismissed about six months later.

The handcuff was locked too tight on Griffin’s wrist, and he began to cry out in pain, asking for it to be loosened. After about 30 minutes, Officer Marozas entered the room and told Griffin to stop yelling, ignoring Griffin’s request to loosen the handcuff. \nAt about noon, Officers Meagher and Marozas entered the room, uncuffed Griffin’s hand and began stepping on Griffin’s shoeless feet. They rushed Griffin to a corner of the room, where they continued to stomp on his bare feet and bend and twist his arms. They repeatedly punched, kicked and kneed Griffin’s body, head and face, before several other officers entered the room and joined in. Officers Law and Marozas then put Griffin in handcuffs and tight leg shackles and dragged him out of the room and down a set of metal stairs.\nGriffin was put into a holding cell, where he cried out in pain, requesting medical care. That night, Griffin was taken to a hospital, where his cuts and injuries were examined. Griffin was then taken back to the police station.

Aguero explained this to Officer Schanelli, who turned to Officer Walker and asked, “What do we do?”\n Walker asked Aguero if he had any traffic tickets, and Aguero said he did. Walker asked Aguero how he knew the plates had been stolen, and Aguero explained that the screws had been removed and his plates were gone. Walker replied, “You know you ain’t getting out of paying for your tickets.” Aguero said that was not his intention. Walker repeated that Aguero needed to pay his tickets, and that he was not fooled by Aguero’s “Latin King gang banging bulls**t.” Aguero is not a member of the Latin King gang.\n Aguero asked for Walker’s badge number, and Walker refused to provide it. Aguero then asked Walker and Schanelli if they were going to help him retrieve his stolen plates, and they replied no. As Aguero exited the station, Walker followed him and approached Aguero’s car. Walker then ordered Schanelli and an unnamed officer to arrest Aguero. Schanelli grabbed Aguero by the arm, and the other officer kneed Aguero in the abdomen and face. Schanelli slammed Aguero to the ground and handcuffed him. \nThey took Aguero back to the station while Walker threatened to write Aguero additional tickets. Walker took Aguero by the neck, walked him to a room and began choking him and punching him in the face and stomach. Aguero repeatedly asked for legal representation and medical care; both were denied. The unnamed officer told Aguero, “Don’t be such a big pussy,” and the officers falsely arrested Aguero for battery. Aguero wrote at least two letters about the incident to the Office of Professional Standards but did not receive a reply.

After stopping him, an unknown officer yanked him out of his vehicle and threw him onto the street. While Dick was on the ground, Officer Kohles put his foot on his head and other officers kicked him. Officers then took Dick home and threatened his family if he didn't sign paperwork allowing them to search his residence. During their search, officers made Dick open a safe and took his guns from it. Dick was then taken to a police station where officers charged him with assault and ten firearm misdemeanors and refused him access to a lawyer. Dick was eventually released on bond but Officer Wojcik ignored this and kept him in custody until he agreed to be admitted to a hospital for "mental conditions." Officers then drove Dick to the West Side Veterans Hospital against his will to try and admit him as a psychiatric patient so he would lose his ability to apply for a gun license. Next, officers lied to Illinois State Police, saying Dick was charged with a felony, in order to revoke his current gun license. Then officers lied about the arrest to the firearm training company Dick worked for and got him fired. The charges against Dick were later dismissed and his guns were returned to him.

Brewer had heard that officers had beaten his brother while arresting him, and Brewer wanted to learn more. After questioning the officers at the station, an officer told Brewer he needed to leave and threatened him with arrest. Brewer left and began to drive away when officers followed him and pulled over his vehicle. The officers ran a name check on him, which revealed no warrants, and they let him go. Several days later, Brewer was back in Michigan when a relative told him his photo was on the TV news as well as the internet, and that police claimed that Brewer was part of the drug-selling ring they were investigating. Eight months later, Brewer was visiting relatives in Oak Lawn when Oak Lawn police officers arrested him on a warrant for his alleged involvement in the drug conspiracy the Chicago police officers were investigating. At his bond hearing, Brewer was charged with four deliveries of narcotics to undercover officers and with being part of a drug conspiracy. Brewer could not afford to post his bail, and he remained in custody at the Cook County Jail for nine months. The trial judge dismissed the charges against Brewer, finding that the officers had incorrectly identified him.

Zarate slammed the door and ran, but was struck in the back by a shot fired by Officer Laska. He collapsed to the ground, and three officers rushed to him. They pushed their knees into his wounded back and forced their elbows into the back of his neck. He was handcuffed with his hands behind his back and turned over, his body weight pressing on his handcuffed hands, right where he had been shot. The officers cursed at him while he was lying on the ground, and one told him that he hoped that he would die. Zarate was transported to a hospital for treatment of his injuries.

Then the officers beat Gonzalez and placed him in a hog-tied position -- his hands cuffed behind his back and his legs shackled. Throughout the incident, Gonzalez displayed obvious signs of distress and difficulty breathing. He was overweight, intoxicated and possibly high on cocaine. One of the officers pepper-sprayed Gonzalez in the face, brought him to the squad car and finally dropped him on the side of the car. They placed him in the squad car in the same hog-tied position.

J.M., who suffers from asthma, was receiving a breathing treatment from a nebulizer machine. Jerome McNeal asked the officers to show him a warrant. Barroso and one or more other officers threw him to the ground, stomped on his left knee and struck him on the left side of this head with a blunt object. He was placed in handcuffs and taken to the apartment’s back porch. By then, officers had taken J.M. off the nebulizer machine and forced the minor, who was in his underwear and T-shirt, to go outside, where he was handcuffed to his mother. While Jerome McNeal, his son and wife were handcuffed on the rear porch, officers searched the apartment without permission. Donetta McNeal told the officers that this was illegal and that she would call the Office of Professional Standards (OPS). Barroso responded, “You think we give a f**k about OPS?

Officers Dieball and Reykjalin pulled up and stopped Riney, telling him that they needed to check to see if he had any outstanding warrants. The officers didn’t have a computer in the police car, so they forced Riney to go to a police station and made him strip and submit to a search. Dieball assured Riney that if they didn’t find anything, they would let him go. But when Riney was naked, the officers told him to bend over and open his buttocks, “called him a name” and handcuffed him to a ring in the wall. When the officers realized that there were no outstanding warrants for Riney, they tried to get him to provide information about anyone who had drugs or guns. Riney refused. The officers loudly insisted that the “deal was off the table” and charged him with possession of one bag of heroin. Riney spent four months in jail before the charges were dismissed.

Orlando was tackled by officers, slammed on to the ground and hit in the legs with a blunt object. Haritos then placed Orlando in a headlock and punched him in the face. Orlando was handcuffed and led out of the home. On the way out, Haritos rammed Orlando's face into a door frame. Officers tackled Lee as he tried to leave through the home's rear exit. Haritos handcuffed him and said, "Nigger, I got you now." Haritos then slammed Lee's head and handcuffed wrists into the trunk of a police car while saying, "Hurts, nigger, don't it." An unknown officer told Mary , "If you don't like this, you shouldn't call 911." No one was given medical attention; instead they were taken to a police station.

The building listed had two units on the second floor: one in the front, one in the rear.\n Two days later, at 8 a.m., several officers executed the warrant and searched the front apartment without finding any weapons, narcotics or other contraband. As the officers were leaving the building, they saw a door that led to the rear apartment. With their guns drawn, the officers forced their way into the second-floor rear apartment where Chilcutt and Otero were sleeping. Without a warrant, the officers searched Chilcutt and Otero’s apartment and found one gram of marijuana, worth about $5. \nThe officers charged Otero with illegal possession of cannabis. About two months later, the charges against Otero were dismissed.

A sergeant with the Melrose Park Police Department informed Officers Lieblick and Loquercio and Detective Wronkowski that Muczynski was the perpetrator of the mace attack, even though he knew this was false. The Chicago officers also knew this was false, but they intimidated and coerced the three individuals who were maced to fabricate statements against Muczynski. Because of these statements, the officers arrested Muczynski and charged him with three counts of battery. The charges were later dismissed after the three witnesses asked the court to withdraw the charges.

During the traffic stop, Wilson reached to make a call on his cellphone. At some point, one of the officers shouted "gun,” falsely indicating to the other officers that Wilson had a gun, even though he was unarmed. Officers Santiago, Vidljinevic and Deleon collectively fired 24 shots at Wilson, 18 of which struck his body, killing him. The officers planted a gun outside Wilson’s car and conspired to create a false account of the incident to explain how the gun ended up outside of the car, claiming that Santiago knocked the gun out of Wilson’s hand using his flashlight.

Marcus Rodriguez rushed home, where an officer asked for his identification before letting him check on Malave and his 14-year-old sister V.R. Marcus asked Lieutenant Proebski for a search warrant, but Proebski told him to go away. When Marcus Rodriguez repeated the question, Proebski pushed him out of the home while another officer grabbed Marcus’ long hair and pulled him down on the stairs outside the home. Officer Berg jumped on Marcus Rodriguez’s back, pushed his head against the ground and handcuffed him. Officers Rooney and McGarry hit Marcus Rodriguez multiple times in the face and ribs. One of the officers also kicked Marcus Rodriguez in the groin. When another officer pulled out a Taser, Stallworth grabbed it. The officers then arrested Stallworth. Berg picked up Marcus Rodriguez and dropped him onto the cement face-first, chipping Marcus Rodriguez’s tooth. The officers put Marcus Rodriguez in a squad car along with his cousin Alex Garcia, Stallworth, V.R. and his upstairs neighbor, Brown. At the police station, Berg repeatedly pretended to lock up V.R. in a cell, taunting Marcus Rodriguez by saying, “How do you like THAT, tough guy?” Marcus Rodriguez was charged with aggravated assault of an officer; everyone else was charged with resisting arrest. V.R. was charged as a juvenile. All of the charges were eventually dismissed except those against Marcus Rodriguez. The police released him at 1:30 a.m., and he went to a hospital where he had a CAT scan and an X-ray for his injuries. As a result, Marcus Rodriguez missed three days of work and was unable to lift anything heavy for several weeks after the incident. The plaintiffs later learned the police had Marcus Rodriguez’s father, who does not live at the family’s apartment, under surveillance. The police continued to harass the family, and Brown moved out of the building because of the frequent harassment.

The officers ordered Blackwell, who was a passenger, to exit the car, and then they searched him. They found no contraband on him. Ford, who owned and had been driving the car, had entered the house to use the bathroom before the officers arrived. The officers took Blackwell’s cellphone and started punching buttons on the phone, while asking him to find them some guns. Blackwell was seized and placed in handcuffs while they searched Ford’s car without a warrant or without permission. Although the officers found no contraband inside, they arrested Blackwell and seized the car. At the police station, officers showed Blackwell bags of a controlled substance. Blackwell protested that he did not have drugs on him, and the officers replied, “You do now.” Blackwell was booked and charged with felony drugs charges and traffic charges. He was incarcerated for two months. Ford never received her car or the personal property that had been inside the car at the time of Blackwell’s arrest. The charges against Blackwell were dismissed.

Halsted St.	-87.6497698000000014	41.9476093000000034	In 2008, Dean and Lopez were driving in the Lakeview neighborhood when Officer Fiorito stopped them and arrested them for DUI. Despite performing the Standardized Field Performance Test, and knowing that they were not driving under the influence, Officer Fiorito charged them with false DUI charges. The officer created false reports and provided false testimony in court. The arrest of Dean and Lopez were part of a series of other improper arrests by Officer Fiorito, done with the purpose of accumulating overtime pay for court appearances. Officer Fiorito is a midnight officer and is paid overtime for every court appearance that is not scheduled during his regular shift. Because all court appearances never occurred while he was on overnight duty, Officer Fiorito was guaranteed overtime pay. Due to the high volume of his cases, the City added “key dates” to his court schedule, happening once a month where the bulk of his cases would be scheduled on those days. However, Fiorito was present in court nearly every day. All of his police reports were similar in content, always claiming that every driver in every DUI arrest would “fail to stay in lanes,” “swerve, speed, drive without headlights,” “almost strike parked cars,” and “fail to wear seatbelts.” Officer Fiorito did this for several years until 2009 when a representative of the Cook County State’s Attorney said that Officer Fiorito’s credibility was being questioned, and therefore, he could no longer be used as witness for the prosecution. The charges against Dean and Lopez were eventually dismissed.

The first incident occurred in September 2007 as Johnson was walking in the East Garfield Park neighborhood. Beckman strip-searched Johnson, pulling down his pants and underwear, while Officer Granville held him. Beckham falsely claimed to find six bags of cocaine on Johnson. The officer arrested Johnson and charged him with possession of cocaine. Johnson spent nearly five months in Cook County Jail until he was granted a motion to quash the arrest and suppress evidence. The second incident took place in March 2009. Beckman again approached, stopped and arrested Earl, accusing him of holding five bags of heroin. He spent more than two months in jail and lost his employment as a result. The case was later dismissed.

Enrique Oliva, who had been with the two, followed the car in his own vehicle, while Jesus Razo and Cortez followed on foot. At 26th Street and Drake Avenue, police stopped the car that had been involved in the hit-and-run. But officers handcuffed Oliva when he showed up to the scene, and shoved Jesus and Evelyn when they arrived and tried to explain what had happened. Some of the officers beat and arrested Jesus. Evelyn called Jesus' family and told them what was happening. But when a relative, Ernesto Razo, showed up and and tried to explain to police that they had made a mistake, officers beat him and arrested him as well. Several hours later, Oliva was released. Jesus was charged with aggravated battery to a police officer. Ernesto was charged with obstructing an officer and battery. Both had to be taken to the hospital for their injuries, which included severe bruises, abrasions and cuts. Charges against both were later dismissed.

Officers ordered Parra to lie down on the ground, handcuffed him and put a foot on Parra’s face. One officer found a handgun in Parra’s waistband, then called him a “stupid Mexican m*********ker,” pointed the gun at his face, hit him several times in the face and head --causing Parra’s head to hit the concrete floor-- and kicked his lower body. The beating caused Parra’s right eye and nose to bleed, his eye to swell shut, and broke his nose; he also suffered facial cuts and strained neck ligaments.

Sarabia kneed Reed in the genitals and placed him in the squad car, stating, “I finally got you now.” When Sarabia was walking back to the other officers, Reed opened the squad car’s door and began running westbound, unnoticed by the officers. Still handcuffed, he hid in an abandoned vehicle in a vacant lot. Sarabia and Wrigley found him and told him to get out of the car and lay on the ground. Reed complied. Sarabia discharged a chemcial spray on Reed’s face and ears while Reed remained handcuffed and on the ground. The officer struck Reed in the face with a closed fist and sprayed the chemical on Reed's skin beneath his underpants. At the same time, Wrigley repeatedly struck Reed on the back of his legs with a police baton as he stood on Reed’s back. Both officers dragged him to a police wagon and deliberately let Reed, who was blinded by the chemical spray, fall and hit his head on a gate. Once inside the police wagon, Reed was allowed to take off his clothes, which were filled with chemical spray.

He was charged with reckless conduct even though officers failed to witness misconduct. While at the station, officers threatened him with lockup if he did not identify a marijuana source. After multiple threats, Pearce identified an individual known as “Hitman”. Pearce had not purchased any drugs from “Hitman” in four months and identified a gang way between two houses in the Ashburn neighborhood as the last place of purchase. An officer submitted a complaint for search warrant naming Rudy Cantu (a.k.a. “Hitman”). In the search warrant, the officer falsely stated that a cooperative individual had approached them with the information after having bought drugs from “Hitman” approximately 30 times over the past three months at a residence on 84th Place. The officer did not inform the State’s Attorney’s Office that Pearce, the cooperative individual, was detained. The next day, the officer sent a second complaint for search warrant. This warrant claimed that Cantu lived in a residence on 78th Place. The officer made false claims that Pearce had purchased drugs from Cantu at this location more than 30 times in the last three months. Pearce was taken to a lock-up and presented before a judge in order to get the warrant approved. Officers told Pearce that if he wanted to get out, he needed to tell the judge that everything on the warrant was true. He was never given the exact details of the warrant’s content. The judge approved the warrant and Pearce was taken back to lockup. Officers proceeded to execute a search warrant of the residence on 78th Place. Livingstone, 56, and her mother, Manny, 83, had lived at this location for over 30 years. Without showing a warrant, the officers detained both women inside the house for two hours even though Livingstone told the officers that her son was a Chicago Police detective. She proceeded to call her son, who later arrived at the scene. The search was called off.

Belmont Ave.	-87.7615976999999958	41.9386314999999996	Officer Abbate Jr. was off-duty and having drinks at Jesse’s Shortstop Inn on West Belmont Avenue when he became so drunk, unruly and abusive that the bartender, Obrycka, refused to serve him any more alcohol. Abbate stepped behind the bar and attacked Obrycka, beating, kicking and punching her. Ababte left, and the police were called to the bar. The manager of the bar, Kolodziej, and a patron, Cepiaszuk, informed officers that Officer Abbate was a Chicago Police officer and that the assault had been recorded on video. A friend of Abbate’s who worked at Jesse’s told him about the tape. Abbate and his friend told Obrycka that if she declined to file a complaint, Abbate in exchange would pay for her medical bills, lost wages and other financial losses because of the beating. Obrycka refused. Abbate and other defendants then turned to threats, telling Obrycka, her manager, and the owner of Jesse’s that if they didn’t turn the videotape over to them or destroy it without showing it to anyone else, their lives--and the lives of other employees and even patrons of Jesse’s--would be in danger and they would be arrested on various trumped-up charges. Obrycka and her manager went to the police department’s Office of Professional Standards, but soon realized that the office was not properly investigating the attack. Representatives for Obrycka and the other plaintiffs gave the videotape of the beating to the media. Abbate was indicted in April 2007 on 14 counts of aggravated battery, official misconduct and conspiracy. Abbate was found guilty of aggravated battery, but acquitted of official misconduct, and sentenced to two years probation.

Laramie Ave.	-87.7556849999999997	41.8985948999999991	Officer Dailey was investigating the whereabouts of two cocaine dealers when he took part in creating two false complaints to obtain a search warrant of a home in the Austin neighborhood. The complaints claimed that on multiple occasions a confidential informant had purchased drugs from the two dealers at the home. Cooper, a 32-year-old decorated police officer, was at the residence with his two minor sons, his wife and his mother when officers forcibly entered the home looking for the two cocaine dealers. Assuming the home was being burglarized, Cooper drew his gun. In response, the officers also drew their guns. Cooper presented the officers with his badge and deed to the building, which he had owned for the past four years. Upon realizing that the warrant had the wrong home and that Cooper was a police officer, the officers decided to execute the search anyway. For 75 minutes, the officers forced the family to stay in one area of the home while the officers and two dogs searched all floors, including an unfinished basement. The officers left after finding no drugs or anyone living in the basement. The officers made reports stating that the Coopers had informed them that one of the cocaine dealers had previously lived in that residence. As a result of this, Cooper lost the trust of his co-workers in the department and has been harassed and intimidated on multiple occasions by off-duty officers waiting in front on his house.

The officers told Swanigan that he looked like a robber and asked him if he was trying to rob the bank. They placed him in tightly bound handcuffs and searched him and his car without his permission. Additional officers arrived at the scene, including Sergeant Kaupert. The officers debated whether they had enough evidence to arrest Swanigan and agreed they did. The officers ordered his car to be impounded and towed. He was taken into custody and detained for more than 50 hours. During that time, he was confined to a small room, shackled to the wall, searched, fingerprinted and never told the reason for his arrest. The arrest report states that Swanigan was arrested for misdemeanors, which did not require the police to hold him for a bail hearing. Detectives Lynch and Mullane put a "hold" request on Swanigan for the purpose of trying to gather evidence against Swanigan for a robbery. During the 50 hours he was in custody, Swanigan was repeatedly moved from one police station to another, interrogated several times by Detectives Lynch and Mullane, denied food and drink, not allowed to sleep, and denied access to the bathroom, all in an attempt to coerce a false confession. Through his detention, Swanigan was ridiculed, threatened and taunted by unknown police officers. During these two days, Swanigan was denied access to an attorney, and his father, a retired police officer, was denied access to his son. Upon release, Swanigan was given two citations, for driving on a suspended license and driving without insurance. These false traffic charges were later dismissed. He received paperwork indicating that his car had been towed for possession of an unlawful firearm, even though the officers did not find a firearm in the car.

In Februray 2006, Tomasz Chraca and Andrzej Bryniarski were sitting in a vehicle at a red light in Clearing when a car pulled up and the passenger fired several shots, striking Chraca in the left leg. Chraca was hospitalized and admitted to have been drinking and using marijuana and cocaine that evening. Bryniarski had also been drinking. Bryniarski admitted to officers that he had not seen the shooter and that he would have a difficult time identifying him. Chraca told officers that he also had not seen the shooter, but that he believed him to be a white male in his 20s. The investigation was suspended for lack of leads, but renewed a month later when officers executed a search warrant of Jakub Rozanski, who attempted to flee with a gun. Rozanski, 22, was arrested with Crawford, 24, and Parker, 26—all white males. Officers found that Rozanski’s gun was the same gun used in the shooting of Chraca. In a line-up, Chraca and Bryniarski identified Crawford as someone resembling the shooter. The investigator in the case requested to interview Crawford and Rozanski where Rozanski was told that the gun he had been arrested with had been used in a shooting. Rozanski denied that Crawford was the shooter and instead named Galindo. He said that Galindo had been a passenger in the car with him and Crawfod. He had only been holding on to the gun at Galindo’s request. A search warrant for Galindo’s home was obtained with claims that drugs would be found. No drugs were found. Galindo was brought in for questioning and used in a line-up where Chraca was asked to identify his shooter. He was not able to make a positive identification, but was prompted by detectives to go with Galindo. Bryniarski was also not able to make a positive identification, but had asked Chraca earlier about who he had picked. Galindo was charged and spent two years in jail. He was found not guilty of the charges.

At the police station, several officers interrogated Hill about many crimes, including the woman’s murder, and used physical force to try to coerce a confession. After initially maintaining his innocence, Hill eventually gave in and falsely admitted to assaulting and murdering the woman. \nHill’s confession also implicated two other men. One of the men had an IQ of 56, well below the benchmark for retardation, and records revealed the other was in jail at the time of the woman’s murder. The officers used physical force to make the two men confess, including beating one with a blackjack and putting a pistol in his mouth. \nThe officers released one of the men Hill had implicated but used false information and destroyed evidence to prosecute Hill and the other man.

The officers searched his home and took $460,000, along with Morales-Placencia’s driver’s license, cellphone and keys. The officers repeatedly threatened to arrest him and his family if he reported their actions. Months later, Finnigan, Villareal and other officers returned to Morales-Placencia’s home, and with his wife and children present, brandished their guns, ransacked the home and again threatened to hurt and arrest him.

Even though Adams complied, Riley kicked and punched him in the face, handcuffed him and continued to hit him as he put him in a squad car. Some of the officers called Adams a "nigger.” His neighbors saw the assault and threw rocks and debris at the officers and yelled at them. As the officers headed to a police station, Adams’ brother and sister, Tari and Sicara, followed them to find out what was happening. Near 26th Street and Sacramento Avenue, the police officers stopped next to the Adams’ car, and Officer Herrera reached through a car window and punched Tari in the face. The Adamses left but when the car was stopped at a red light O'Shaughnessy and Hopkins hit the side of the car with their police cruiser. When Sicara and Tari got out, officers tackled Tari and hit him several times in the back of the head. The Adams siblings were each charged with various felonies and misdemeanors, including aggravated battery/assault to a police officer and unlawful use of a weapon. The charges against Sicara were dismissed. Tari and Seneca were acquitted of felony charges and initially found guilty of misdemeanors, but those charges were also dismissed when evidence surfaced that the officers had been involved in similar misconduct.

The case began when Robinson was arrested in September 2004 for domestic battery. While in custody, Officers Humphrey and Boock repeatedly questioned him about a murder three years earlier. Police beat, whipped and threatened Robinson to make him confess, but Robinson repeatedly denied involvement and asked for a lawyer. Robinson was in police custody for three days. Humphrey said Robinson confessed, but there was no record to support the claim. Boock repeated Humphrey’s claim about the confession to a grand jury, which indicted Robinson for the murder. The officers’ testimony was the only evidence against him. The officers also repeatedly denied beating Robinson, even though photographs showed Robinson’s injuries. While Robinson was in jail, Humphrey called Robinson’s wife, attempting to date her. During one of these conversations, Humphrey told her that the officers lied to the grand jury. A judge acquitted Robinson of the murder charge in October 2007.

Drawing their guns, the officers got out and confronted Gutierrez, cursing at him and demanding that he get out. The officers handcuffed and searched Gutierrez and his car, without a warrant or consent. The officers didn’t find any evidence of a crime, but took Gutierrez’s keys, pepper-sprayed his dogs and went to enter Gutierrez’s home. By this time, Negrete had been awakened by the noise and came to the door. The officers demanded to come inside, but when Negrete asked if they had a search warrant, they threw her onto the sofa and handcuffed her. Police searched both apartments in the building and found narcotics, then told Negrete she would be in trouble if she didn’t tell them “where to find the money.” They also threatened to take her children and told her she could “sign papers” and avoid being arrested. Negrete told them where to find money, but refused to sign any papers without an explanation or a lawyer. The officers then cursed at her and told her she’d be going to jail. Police took $50,000 in cash and jewelry worth $45,000 from the home. Gutierrez spent about 10 days in jail before posting bond on narcotics and gun charges. Negrete spent two days in jail before posting bond on narcotics charges. All the charges were later dismissed.

From January 2004 to January 2005, officers repeatedly entered the plaintiffs' home without legal justification. Officers handcuffed the plaintiffs, threw them to the ground and demanded money from them. During these home invasions officers would threaten the plaintiffs with arrest and drug charges if they didn't give money to Officer Flagg. As part of their extortion schemes officers arrested Larry Wilkins on Aug. 6, 2004 without any legal justification, planted cocaine on him, and charged him with possession of cocaine and gun charges. The charges were later dismissed. Officers would regularly threaten the plaintiffs with arrest if they alerted authorities to the officers' misconduct. Officer Flagg planned home invasions and vehicle stops around times he knew the plaintiffs would have social security checks or checks from salaried employment with them. And in 2004, from July to December, officers attempted to steal at least ten kilograms of cocaine and at least $60,000 through fake drug stings set up using their police powers. Officers later pleaded or were found guilty of their misconduct and racketeering activities.

Division St.	-87.6308827000000008	41.9039049000000006	David Koschman was walking with a group of people near Division and Wells streets in April 2004, when they encountered a group that included Richard Vanecko, a nephew of then-mayor Richard M. Daley. The groups got into a verbal argument. Suddenly, without provocation, Vanecko punched Koschman in the face, knocking him to the ground. Koschman hit his head on the pavement, resulting in skull fractures and massive internal bleeding. Within hours of the incident, Daley or a close associate learned about Vanecko’s involvement and reached out to high-ranking Police Department officials who immediately stopped the investigation. Koschman never regained consciousness and died in the hospital about two weeks later. His death was ruled a homicide and the investigation was reopened. Detectives changed and fabricated reports and concealed evidence from witness statements in order to minimize or hide Vanecko’s involvement and portray Koschman as the aggressor. The reports were used by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office to avoid bringing criminal charges against Vanecko.In 2011, a new investigation was ordered by then-Supt. Jody Weis, but detectives once again fabricated information and conspired with Daley’s office and the State’s Attorney’s Office to ensure that Vanecko wouldn’t be charged. In 2012, a Cook County judge appointed a special prosecutor in the case. After he was indicted, Vanecko pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter.

As they approached Carrie Warfield’s house, the women heard several gunshots nearby. They ran to the house and banged on the door, hoping that Carrie Warfield’s sister, Lagina Warfield, would open the door. While the women waited, a man who was bleeding from a gunshot wound in his leg ran up to them. Officers Chapman and Collier approached the group and began shooting. The man moved to block the women from the gunfire, taking several bullets in the chest. A bullet fired by the officers also hit a 13-year-old bystander. Carrie Warfield then cried out, “My baby, you shot my baby.” Although Carrie Warfield did not have a child with her, the trick worked, and the officers stopped firing and ran off. The women carried the man inside the house, and Carrie Warfield—not realizing that Chapman and Collier were police officers—called 911. Soon after, several police officers entered Carrie Warfield’s house with guns drawn and forced everyone to the basement. They demanded the women produce a gun, and searched the women one at a time. The officers then told the group, including Lagina Warfield’s 8-year-old son, to exit the house through the back door and go to a police station for questioning. At the station, the women were accused of lying about the incident and about not owning a gun. Jennifer Warfield, who was pregnant at the time, was not allowed to use the bathroom and urinated on herself. The officers also did not let Lagina Warfield go to work. The women were forced to stay at the station until the next morning. When they returned home, the house was in shambles: torn curtains, holes in the walls, the refrigerator tipped over, and the stove overturned.

The victim was found shot to death on a sidewalk in the University Village neighborhood. Two months later, Officers Nallen, Fowler, Nielsen and Little arrested Nixon in the same neighborhood where the death occurred, and took him to a police station. For more than 30 hours, Nixon, who repeatedly asked for a lawyer, was physically abused and threatened by Det. Hermann, Swiderek, Deenihan and the four officers until he falsely confessed to the murder. Police had Nixon rehearse the confession and then recorded it in the presence of an assistant state’s attorney. Nixon was found not guilty in June 2007.

Her children also worked with her as community activists to support the rights of criminal suspects and defendants in police custody. In May 2004, Molina was at home visiting with Guzman, her son’s fiancée, when officers raided her apartment. Molina and her son, Michael Ortiz, were arrested after officers falsely claimed to find illegal drugs in their possession. Ortiz was also accused of holding plastic explosives, which were in fact compounds used for drywall installation. All of the charges against Ortiz were later dropped after the officers admitted they recovered no illegal substances or other contraband. After the raid, Guzman was instructed to leave and not bother to look for her purse, which contained nearly $400 in cash; she had another $2,000 locked for safekeeping in Molina’s apartment. Later, when Guzman returned, the money from her purse was gone, as was the $2,000, which she had saved over time to rent a new apartment. Molina, who suffered from various medical conditions, was handcuffed to her wheelchair and taken to a police station where she was booked and taken into custody. Her daughter, April Ortiz, arrived that evening and asked if she could deliver medication for Molina, who had ailments including a thyroid condition, asthma and diabetes. Despite her insistence, April Ortiz’s request was denied. Some hours later, Molina’s attorney went to visit her in the lockup. Seeing that she was unwell, he advised that Molina be taken to the hospital. No officers complied with this request for medical attention, and eight hours later, Molina died in her cell. Officers prolonged Michael Ortiz's detention, causing him to miss his mother’s funeral.

The cruiser was traveling 20 miles per hour over the speed limit on the wrong side of the yellow line when it struck the children. Jones and Mitchell were taken to hospitals in critical condition. Jones died the next day. Mitchell survived with multiple fractures of her leg, ear, elbow and skull.

McGee told them that he didn't know anything about the murder, other than what he had heard on the news. Detectives Farley and Lenihan asked McGee to take a lie detector test. He agreed, but asked if they could postpone it, as his wedding was in a few days. Two days later, and three days before McGee's wedding, the detectives arrested McGee at his house and brought him to Area 1, where they interrogated him again. They threated to hold him for 72 hours unless he submitted to a lie detector test, knowing that this would cause him to miss his own wedding. They ignored McGee's repeated requests for a lawyer. Officers Bartik, Farley and Lenihan then conspired to fabricate a story that McGee confessed to the murder twice, once to Officer Bartik and once to all three officers. Based on this fabricated confession, and no other evidence, McGee was charged with the murder, even though DNA from blood found at the scene did not match him and, in fact, matched two other people. McGee was incarcerated for more than three years before he was finally acquitted by a jury. McGee missed his wedding date and the birth of his son.

Despite this, detectives kept Kimball in the room for more than three days straight, allowing him to leave only to take a lie detector test, appear in a lineup, and use the bathroom one time. He was not allowed to use a phone and he was not given anything to eat.\nIn 2000, Robinson was at work as a mail carrier when a Chicago detective approached him. The detective said he had an arrest warrant for Robinson, but never produced it.

The case against the three relied partly on a coerced statement given by a 17-year-old girl who initially said she had introduced Fulton to Collazo but gave a false statement implicating him in the murder after police yelled at her, showed her pictures of the murdered victim and threatened to charge her with the crime. Fulton was then arrested, but repeatedly denied any involvement in the murder and told police he had an alibi that could be proven by a videotape. But after police abused him physically and psychologically, Fulton gave a false statement about the crime. Mitchell and Shaw were also arrested and coerced to make false statements about the murder. Police had no physical evidence linking the three to the crime.

When the rally ended, the crowd of an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 people marched peacefully through downtown, chanting anti-war slogans and carrying signs and banners. Police escorted the demonstrators as they marched east to Lake Shore Drive and headed north. Officers briefly blocked the marchers at Michigan Avenue and Oak Street, then directed the crowd to head south. At Chicago Avenue, officers “herded and corralled” hundreds of the marchers just east of Michigan. About 800 people were detained for hours, forced to stand jam-packed together and surrounded by police, many of the officers wearing riot gear and carrying batons. Eventually, 200 to 250 of the protesters were allowed to leave, but only after police forced them to give up their anti-war signs, banners, flyers and pins. Over 500 people were arrested, handcuffed, searched and taken to police stations miles away—the men to the far South Side, the women to the West Side. Police held them for up to 40 hours in overcrowded and overheated cells and refused to give them food or allow them to make phone calls, receive medical treatment and have items for personal hygiene. Police records were falsified to cover up the neglect. Some of those arrested were not part of the demonstration, but were picked up as they walked to nearby hotels, got off buses or came from restaurants. Of those arrested, over 200 people were released without being charged and about 300 were charged with reckless conduct, a misdemeanor.

Head's attacker was not identified by witnesses on the scene the night of the murder. Under pressure to solve the murder and without any leads, officers coerced witnesses into identifying Patterson as Head's attacker. Officers held witness Leslie Herron without food, water or anywhere to sleep for three days. During that time Herron had not identified Patterson as the attacker. So officers allowed Herron to "overhear" information on Patterson in order to get a false identification of him as Head's murderer. After officers successfully got a false identification of Patterson, they buried all substantial evidence, like DNA test results of the murder weapon, which could prove that Patterson was innocent. In 2003, Patterson was wrongfully convicted of Head's murder and sentenced to 30 years in prison. In 2007, Patterson filed a Freedom of Information Act request which included the DNA test results of the murder weapon. The test results resulted in a new trial where Patterson was found not guilty of Head's murder.

A few weeks later, Wisniewski was asleep in his apartment when officers with the police department's Special Operations Section (SOS) broke in without justification and woke him up with a gun pointed in his face. They asked Anthony where his father, Donald Wisniewski, lived and Anthony gave officers the address. Soon after, Anthony moved back in with his parents. On Feb. 15, 2003 only A.W., Anthony's younger brother who was 14 at the time, was home when officers knocked on the door and then broke through the front door without justification. Officers pushed A.W. against a wall and searched the house. Then they brought A.W. into the dining room to ask where his father kept his guns and where his father and brother were. Terrified, A.W. answered all their questions. Officers stole seven of Donald's guns, but only inventoried four of them, and then went to a nearby tavern where they roughly arrested Donald, who had recently undergone triple-bypass surgery, and Anthony. Both men were taken to a police station. Donald was charged with failure to register his guns and Anthony was charged with disorderly conduct. Donald was also threatened with a child endangerment charge, prison or death should he file a complaint about his arrest on any officers.

Cook told the officers he had broken his neck years ago and had stopped riding motorcycles. When Cook asked Denine Gersloki to call 911, the officers threatened to handcuff and abuse her. Finnigan and Fuelling then dragged Cook up the stairs to the second floor. "Where's the stuff? they asked. Cook told the officers he didn’t have anything

Two unnamed officers responded, spent about 15 to 20 minutes at the home, then left. Half an hour later, Fenton called police again to report a domestic disturbance. The same officers responded and escorted the girlfriend’s son outside, in subfreezing weather, where he said he would wait for a friend to pick him up. He walked half a block away and the officers left. Within six minutes, he returned to the house and tried to break in. Fenton called the police, but by the time they arrived, the girlfriend’s son had stabbed Fenton and beaten him with a hammer, killing him.

Halsted St.	-87.6422510000000017	41.6863011000000014	In January 1983, Logan, then 28, was convicted of murdering a correctional officer and shooting a sheriff’s deputy who were working off duty as security guards at a fast-food restaurant. Two other men committed the crimes. Logan’s conviction was the result of misconduct by the investigating officers, including Cmdr. Burge, who failed to disclose evidence to prosecutors that Logan was not guilty and who conspired to build a false case against him. Throughout his 26 years in prison, Logan pleaded with the judicial system to hear evidence concerning his innocence. When the man who killed the correctional officer died in 2008, his former attorneys disclosed a 1982 affidavit pertaining to Logan’s innocence and their client’s guilt in the case. This led a judge to overturn Logan’s conviction, and the state to grant him a Certificate of Innocence. Logan was 56 when he was released.

D.L. did not speak English, and did not understand what the woman was saying. His cousin alerted D.L.’s mother, who called the police to clear up the confusion. Officers Okrasinski and Herrera arrived and took D.L. to a police station for questioning without allowing his mother to come. D.L. was held and questioned for 48 hours; during this time he was not allowed to eat, make a phone call or see his family. After repeatedly denying that he had anything to do with the crime, D.L. requested a lie detector test to prove his innocence. D.L. was taken to Officer Bartik, who continued to question him without a polygraph exam. Although D.L. continued to state his innocence, the officers filed a report claiming D.L. had confessed to the crime prior to asking for a polygraph test. The officers began to threaten D.L., telling him he would never see his mother again and he would be raped in Cook County Jail if he did not confess. They gave him a form to sign that was written in English, a language he could not read, speak or write. If D.L. signed the form, the officers said, he could go home. One officer even pretended to call D.L.’s mother, acting out a conversation in which he told her to come pick up D.L. D.L. signed the form, which was a false confession the officers had written. D.L. was taken to Cook County Jail and charged with 26 counts of sexual assault to a minor and other offenses. D.L. had no prior criminal record or any experience with police. The real molester was eventually caught and prosecuted, and all charges against D.L. were dropped.

Although Scott immediately denied any involvement in the crime, he was interrogated for more than 40 hours. There was no evidence or eyewitness account linking Scott to the murder. When Scott was arrested, he began suffering from heroin withdrawal as well as severe nausea, back pain and a painful sore on his foot. \nScott spent the next two days locked in an interrogation room, where he maintained his innocence. He was not allowed to go to the bathroom, so he urinated and vomited on the floor. The officers told Scott they would provide medical care only if he confessed to the murder. After two days, the police drove Scott to the murder scene and continued to accuse him of murder. Desperate for medical care, Scott provided false statements linking himself to the murder. He was convicted based on the statements. Six years later, the conviction was overturned, and the charges against Scott were dismissed a year after that.

The officers ordered Montaño and four other men to put their hands on the squad car, which the men did. Officer Atilano, who thought Montaño was the person who had insulted LaFrancis, hit Montaño in the groin, called him “motherf****r,” and hit him in the back with a flashlight. Officer Toolis hit Montano in the neck and face with a flashlight and choked him. LaFrancis also grabbed Montaño by the hair. Much of the attack was captured on videotape. The other men were also hit and injured by various officers. At the police station, Officer Lopez hit Montaño in the face and hit and kicked him, and the other men were strip-searched. They were charged with disorderly conduct, and some of them were charged with resisting arrest and drinking in the public way. The charges were later dismissed.

At the time of Gillard’s trial, scientists in the Chicago Police Department Crime Lab either did not perform or did not disclose DNA testing that would have proven Gillard could not have committed the crime. In 2008, DNA tests proved without question that Gillard could not have been the rapist. Gillard received a Certificate of Innocence from Cook County.

The following day officers arrested Wilson, an African-American man, at the same bus stop. Over the course of 30 hours police verbally threatened and physically attacked Wilson to coerce him into signing a false confession. Officers also denied Wilson sleep, food and his blood pressure medication in order to coerce him into saying he attacked Siler. Fearing for his life Wilson signed a statement written by Officer Healy. Officers Rolston and McInerney then manipulated Siler into identifying Wilson as her attacker. Meanwhile, in the two weeks following the attack on Siler, Wagner attacked five additional women. These other five attacks all happened within a one and a half mile radius of the attack on Siler and involved women Wagner thought were White who he stabbed on the street. Wagner was arrested on March 15, 1997 wearing a pair of black Velcro shoes matching the ones Siler told police her attacker was wearing when she was attacked. Det. Triggs charged Wagner with the five other attacks, but not Siler's. At no point did officers speak to Siler about Wagner's arrest or ask Wagner if he attacked Siler. Wilson was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to 30 years in prison. In 2006, after serving nine years of his sentence, Wilson's conviction was reversed. During this time Siler learned about Wagner's series of attacks for the first time. She apologized to Wilson and recanted her earlier testimony.

Instead of arresting Nash, the officers took his money and pager. They also said Nash would be “sorry” if he told anyone. Still, Nash told people in the neighborhood that two police officers had robbed him.\n A few months later, three masked men robbed and fatally shot a man named Leon Stroud in his home. There were two witnesses to the incident, one inside and one outside the home. Both witnesses said they saw three men enter the home and shoot Stroud, and one of the witnesses identified Alvin Wyatt as one of the three masked men. The police questioned Wyatt, who denied any involvement in the incident. Investigators interviewed Wyatt again and used verbal and physical force to make him say he was in Stroud’s home and met only one other man there. The investigators told Wyatt he would not be charged or go to jail if he agreed to tell this story. Wyatt agreed, and Officers Solecki and Baker, who are Area 2 police officers, arrested Nash despite proof that he had been shopping the day of the incident. Solecki and Baker then put Nash in a suggestive lineup. One of the witnesses identified Nash as one of the masked men. The witness, however, had known Nash for years and had not named him earlier. Solecki and Baker hid evidence proving Nash’s innocence from prosecutors, and failed to disclose the fact that both witnesses saw three masked men leave the home, rather than two. Despite no physical evidence connecting Nash to the crime, Nash was convicted of murder. He spent the next 17 years in prison. In October 2007, Nash filed a motion to seek DNA testing on the mask found at the crime scene. Three years later, a test revealed that Nash did not match either of the DNA profiles found on the mask. Two years later, Nash received a certificate of innocence and all charges against him were dismissed.

The victim was white and only knew her attacker was African-American and that he'd warned her not to open her eyes or she'd be killed. She also contracted multiple sexually transmitted diseases from the rape. Based on an anonymoust tip, officers brought the victim to Ben's Meat Market, where Cage worked, and she identified him as her attacker. At the time of the rape, Cage was at home with his fiance and, once in police custody, he could prove he had no sexually transmitted diseases. Officers charged Cage with the 15-year-old's rape anyway, and his bond was set at half a million dollars, which Cage's family was unable to pay. Officers also tried to link a second, unrelated rape of a 29-year-old African-American woman to the Cage, but Cage was later acquitted of this other woman's rape thanks to DNA evidence. Instead of trying to find the victim's actual attacker, officers then decided to portray Cage as a serial rapist and tie him to a string of at least eight other rapes alongside the one involving the 15-year-old girl. To this end, officers fabricated evidence, manipulated witnesses, destroyed police reports and obscured the fact that Cage's DNA and fingerprints were never found at the crime scene where the 15-year-old girl was raped. In 1996, Cage was convicted of three counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault and sentenced to 20 years in prison. While incarcerated, Cage pleaded with the courts to permit DNA testing on the biological material recovered from the 15-year-old victim's rape, even offering to pay for the testing himself. His requests were denied until 2006, when the Cook County State's Attorneys' Office finally agreed to the testing. Cage was exonerated and the criminal charges against him were dismissed thanks to the DNA evidence.

Detectives Stewart and Barnes believed the assault was perpetrated by a serial rapist who remained at large in the community. They had a sketch prepared based on descriptions from other victims, and sent the drawings to various neighborhoods on the South Side.\nAbout six months later, Pendleton was sitting in a bar where a copy of the sketch was posted on the wall. The bartender believed Pendleton resembled the sketch, and Pendleton was arrested and forced to stand in a lineup. None of the four victims who viewed the lineup identified Pendleton as the attacker, and Detectives Barnes and Stewart released him.\nAround the same time, A.H. saw the suspect’s sketch on a news broadcast and told the police she believed he was the same man who had attacked her. Detectives Stewart and Barnes brought Pendleton back to a station to be placed in a lineup. As A.H. was waiting in a nearby room, the detectives escorted Pendleton past the room in full view of A.H., who became upset and believed Pendleton was the man who had attacked her. \nPendleton, however, did not match the description A.H. originally gave of the attacker. She said her attacker weighed about 170 pounds, but Pendleton only weighed 135 pounds. She also said the attacker carried a gun in his right hand, but Pendleton is left-handed. And she said the attacker had rotten teeth, but Pendleton’s teeth were in good condition.\nDetectives Stewart and Barnes filed false police reports without requesting that the crime lab conduct DNA testing. Pendleton was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Twelve years later, Pendleton obtained a court order for independent DNA testing of the evidence. In 2006, the DNA test confirmed Pendleton’s innocence, and he was released from prison.

The following month, a convicted felon serving time in a downstate prison called detectives and promised information about the murders in exchange for a transfer to a work-release program. He told the detectives that Reeves and another man had separately called him and confessed to the murders, which was not true. The detectives and an assistant state's attorney had the informant call the two men at least 36 times to try to get them to admit to the crime, but neither did so. Nevertheless, officers arrested one of the men and brought him to a police station, where they beat him with a blackjack, telephone and telephone book and kicked and punched him repeatedly over several hours. Eventually, the man gave a false confession, implicating himself and Reeves in the murders. Reeves was arrested in August 1988, and the two men were charged with the murders. They were both convicted. In 1995, their convictions were vacated, but they were re-tried and re-convicted in 1997, again based almost entirely on the informant’s false testimony. In 2009, after evidence of the practice of torture by the "midnight crew" led by Cmdr. Burge and the other defendant officers had been uncovered, Reeves was exonerated and released from prison after 21 years.

The case was extensively covered by the media and put pressure on police to quickly solve it. Kitchen was not the killer, but officers, including Lt. Burge, fabricated evidence to charge him with the crimes. On the night of his arrest, Kitchen was taken to a police station. For 16 hours, officers deprived him of food and sleep; subjected him to repeated acts of extreme physical abuse, primarily by Burge; taunted and subjected him to racial epithets and refused to allow him to speak to an attorney. Ultimately, the officers coerced Kitchen into signing a statement that implicated him and another individual in the murders. Kitchen spent 21 years in prison, 13 under the death sentence, for five murders he did not commit and to which he had no connection.

Among the officers present at the crime scene was Lt. Burge, who worked with other area police officers to charge Caine with a crime he did not commit. The officers forced Caine and his co-defendant into making false confessions by using psychological and physical torture. While alone in an interrogation room, Caine’s co-defendant scratched into the bench that he had been tortured and that his statements to the police were false. After hours of torture, the co-defendant signed a false statement about his involvement in the murders. He also claimed, through instruction from Burge and other officers, that Caine had been present at the murder scene. Caine was arrested at his mother’s home based solely on the co-defendant’s coerced statement. In the interrogation room, Caine insisted he knew nothing about the killings. Officer Madigan proceeded to coach Caine with details of the murder for his statement. When Caine refused to sign the prepared statement, Madigan struck him with a cupped hand on the side of his head, rupturing his eardrum. In pain from the ruptured eardrum and fearing additional torture, Caine signed the statement. Caine was convicted of murder, home invasion and residential burglary. He spent 25 years in prison until he was ultimately exonerated.

He voluntarily accompanied the officers to a police station. He was placed in an interrogation room, forced onto a bench and handcuffed to a metal ring attached to the wall. Detectives Madigan and McWeeny questioned Andrews about gunshots at a dog fight and asked if he knew two men—murder victims whose deaths the officers were investigating. Shortly after, the detectives accused Andrews of murdering the men. According to police reports, Burge, a lieutenant and commanding officer of a violent crimes unit, had coordinated and supervised the investigation of the murders, including Andrews’ arrest. Every time he was questioned, Andrews denied any involvement. As a result, the officers physically and verbally abused Andrews. He was denied his Miranda rights, access to an attorney, a phone call and food. Andrews was beaten with a heavy-duty police-issue flashlight and endured continuous fist punches. Madigan attempted to coach Andrews about the details of the murder, telling him what he was to say in a statement to the State’s Attorney’s Office. During the session, Madigan repeatedly struck Andrews with the flashlight and his fists. After eight hours of interrogation and torture, Andrews confessed to murdering one of the two victims, reciting the story that was given to him. After this first statement, the officers continued to physically and psychologically torture him. Four hours after his first statement, and 12 hours after being arrested, Andrews confessed to the second murder. During the murder trials, Andrews presented his sworn testimony about the abuses to which he was subjected prior to his coerced statements. The officers testified that Andrews had confessed voluntarily. Andrews was convicted of the murders without any physical evidence linking him to the crime. Andrews was incarcerated for 24 years for crimes he did not commit.

They chained him to a wall, yelled at him and hit him with flashlights and their fists. The detectives coerced a confession from Andrews that implicated Fauntleroy in the Lewis murder. Fauntleroy was then arrested based on Andrews' coerced confession and nothing else. During his transport to the police station, Detectives Madigan and McWeeny took Fauntleroy to an undeveloped, wooded area near 111th Street and the Bishop Ford Expressway and said, "Look at him, that's how they look when they're guilty." Det. McWeeny pointed a gun at Fauntleroy and said, "How would you like it if I used this on him?" Fauntleroy urinated himself. Detectives then took Fauntleroy to a police station and initially did not tell him why he was there. Detectives McWeeny and Madigan then questioned Fauntleroy by chaining him to a wall, asking him about the murder and hitting him with flashlights and their fists. Fauntleroy asked for a phone to call a lawyer or his family. Det. McWeeny responded, "This ain't a TV show. You get a phone call when we get what we want." Fauntleroy was denied food and water, could not use a restroom and was not read his Miranda rights while he was in custody. Detectives then brought Assistant State's Attorney William Merrit to Fauntleroy. Detectives told Fauntleroy that Merrit was a lawyer so he wouldn't need to call his family to get one of his own. Fauntleroy then told Merrit, who he thought was his lawyer and not a prosecutor, what the detectives had coached him into saying so he could leave police custody. Fauntleroy was convicted of the murder and armed robbery of Lewis in 1986 and sentenced to life in prison plus 60 years. In 2009, Fauntleroy's conviction was vacated. He was released from prison after the Cook County State's Attorney decided not to pursue a new trial.

The officers were investigating the rape of a woman in the Roseland neighborhood that happened on Nov. 24, 1951. At the time of his arrest, Walden, Jr. had not been identified, either in person or by photograph, as the attacker in the rape. Officers then told the rape victim they'd arrested a "colored man" and wanted her to identify him. At the station officers questioned Walden, Jr. in front of the victim. The victim didn't say anything or identify Walden, Jr. as her attacker. Officers moved Walden, Jr. to another room and asked him where he was the night of the rape. During their questioning officers denied Walden, Jr. access to a lawyer and wouldn't let him call his wife. Officers then accused him of rape, kicked him in the shins and gave him a lie detector test before locking him in a cell for the night. The next day Officer Faculak lied to Walden, Jr., saying he'd failed the lie detector, in order to coerce him into a confession. Officer Faculak continued to threaten Walden, Jr. into confessing, saying he'd be transferred to another police station where "they are pretty rough" if he didn't admit to the rape. Officer Faculak promised leniency if he confessed but Walden, Jr. maintained his innocence. Officer Faculak then bent Walden, Jr.'s fingers back and scratched them to cause bleeding. Det. Sweitzer hit Walden, Jr.'s head a few times and said, "You are lying, nigger." Officers also took turns kicking Walden, Jr.'s shins. Officers next threatened to get a rope, strip Walden, Jr. naked and hang him from a high bar while they beat him with a rubber hose. Officers also said they would get his family evicted, arrested and put in different jails. Terrified, Walden, Jr. signed a false statement. Police also forced him to apologize to the victim in front of them. Walden, Jr. was charged and convicted of rape and sentenced to 75 years in prison. On Nov. 18, 1965, after serving 14 years of his sentence, Walden, Jr. was granted parole. On Jan. 13, 2003 Walden, Jr. received a pardon of innocence.
